This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "takes some getting used to", "unixReviewTime": 1380240000, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2013"}

We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program.  We continued to use these bands for pull-upsThe Good:These bands are easy to use, and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful.  Some people may need more weight than this set can provide.  Since my wife did not use the &#34;heaviest&#34; red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.The Bad:Out of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp.  I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band.  Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate.  Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.Overall:I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.  As soon as I switched to some &#34;dial weights&#34; I felt I was getting a better workout.  The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all.  In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.Still, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands.

In my opinion....they are bogus posts.  I have these....and here are my findings.1.  They are awkward at first, as with any new skill you try when lifting weights.2.  Someone said he couldn't use his \"normal\" weight when doing incline press.....if you can do 90 lb incline press WITH DUMBBELLS then these hooks will NOT hamper your ability in doing incline presses with the same weight.  That doesn't even make sense.  However....if you never or rarely do certain exercises with dumbbells then yes, you will have to lower the weight...at first.  Anyone who lifts knows if you go from a bar to dumbbells then you will have to take time to get used to each arm lifting independently.3.  Yes....it will take a few times to get used to placing your bench just right under the bar that holds the hooks for you.  I do not bump the bar when using these.  And just like lifting on your own, without a spotter, with a barbell.....it's no different with dumbbells.  You need to be able to muscle them back up to hook the bar.4.  They are NOT made to be dropped!!!  They are made to hook on the bar when your set is done.  I read a review on here that complained that they get banged up or something when you drop the dumbbells.  Duh!  You wouldn't throw your barbell on the floor when you got done bench pressing, would you?  No....then why would you think you would throw these on the floor?  It doesn't make sense.  These hooks are designed to be placed BACK on the bar after your set...NOT thrown on the floor.5.  They are comfortable...to me.  Unless you don't find padded material comfortable, you will find them comfortable too.  Someone actually said that if you have big hands then you can't use these.  What?????  They fit ON THE HANDLE!  If your hands don't fit around a dumbbell handle then it's not the hooks fault.  They take up ZERO space on the handle, other than adding just a few centimeters in thickness around the handle.6.  In my opinion....they also help prevent shoulder injuries from trying to muscle up the dumbbells to their position.  There are a few videos on youtube demonstrating these hooks.  There is also one that shows how to use chains hanging from a power cage or from rafters in your basement hooked on to these as a spotting system in case you can't muscle them back up to rehang them back on the bar.  I have the chains hanging from the top of my power cage and attached to the hooks so I can go to exhaustion on my last set without the worry of dropping the weights on the floor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've had these for about a year.", "unixReviewTime": 1385769600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2013"}

Dean \"John\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I had waited a while trying to flatten out the &#34;green&#34; since it was all kinked and bumpy from being rolled up for storage and shipment.  I hadn't thought of ironing it like another reviewer mentioned they did.I've had a small auto-return cup, the &#34;normal&#34; style, that my 10 year old and I use around the house, but I never cared for just having that piece only, and having to putt across the carpet.  So I liked that this gave a better surface to putt over.  It is considerably better than just using carpet or hard flooring.However, that's about where the good things I can say about this ends.  It's not very well made.  The first real dislike I had was the fake background.  It slides into a slot, which would be fine, except they put VELCRO on this.  Anyone who knows Velcro knows that it's not something that can &#34;slide&#34; into place.  The fasteners start to catch as soon as you get this in place, so you can't just insert it.  It would've been MUCH better to just have been held by friction and pressure.  You can kind of almost get it in alright if you very carefully pull it as hard against the &#34;front&#34; of the slot as you can to try to keep all the Velcro from attaching, but it's not something that should even be an issue.  I ended up just putting it inside a box tipped on its side to catch any balls that would jump the rear ledge when my son gets a little enthusiastic about his swing.The plastic is some pretty low grade material as well, the kind that cracks pretty easily.The cord has a pretty average length, so at least it's not too short to reach an outlet somewhere without having this right up against the wall. But I've seen better ball return systems.  I thought at first it may just be because I had it in the box so it wasn't quite set up the way it &#34;should&#34; be, but even removing it from there, I encountered many instances of having to scuff my foot along the &#34;green&#34; to wiggle it enough to get the ball to activate the system.  Sometimes that wasn't enough and I had to walk up to it and nudge with my foot to get it to return.  The return power at least was adequate to get the ball back to me.The length of the green is good, but I would have preferred something with a little more solid of a base, some heavier rubberized base, so that you could store it rolled up again, but still have it lay flat as soon as you unrolled it.  This stuff tends to keep those bends in it slightly when you pull it out to use again.  I can see keeping it with the cheaper stuff if they were concerned about weight, but I would've preferred something heavier to lay flat instantly when I want to use it.All told, I'm just not very impressed with this one other than the putting surface itself once I get it to stay flat.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It's alright, but I've seen better", "unixReviewTime": 1402963200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2014"}

The putting mat is all one piece; there is no gap or attaching of the putting surface.  You just unroll it.  It's not the BEST surface; mine has been unrolled for days, but is still &#34;bumpy&#34; from where it was unrolled.  But, it's all one piece.  The only things you need to do is attach the tree-backdrop (velcro is used here), add a sticker for the bottom of the &#34;hole&#34;, and stick in the flag.  I noticed the instructions were not applicable to the putting green I received; the instructions talked about putting the ball-return in place, etc, but really this is plug and play.  I did notice a problem with the flag; the hole that holds it goes down into the ball-return area, so I just don't use the flag.  The neat thing about this is that if you mis-hit a ball into the &#34;water&#34; or &#34;trap&#34;, it feeds the ball into the center area and shoots the ball back at you.  It's a powerful ball-return; it seems to depend on where the ball is located once the ball-return kicks in.  Sometimes the ball would roll back off the mat, sometimes it would make it halfway.It functions just fine.  Even with the &#34;bumps&#34; in the mat, I still made good putts.  It's more of a neat toy than a serious practice device:  the hole has an incline just before it, so you have to hit the ball harder than you would normally.  I had some solid shots get hung up on the incline at the end.  Your mis-hits have to be gentle; I had a few roll up onto the back of the green and roll back down, blocking the path of future hits.

My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They've beat Leatherman at their own game!", "unixReviewTime": 1259366400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2009"}

(You know the one's on everyone's TV kitchen) ... This griddle cooks pancakes, french toast, cheese sandwiches and eggs on the smooth side wonderfully. Just kick the burners on high, let it warm up, knock them back to medium until its hot evenly and throw the food on. Don't worry about heating an empty pan, Cast iron can take it. When a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready. (Smoking is too hot, duh!)The other great use is to put it in the oven, turn the broiler/oven on and let it heat up. Then toss on the steaks, ribs, or fish! Yum!The Lodge seasoning is ok for that first time cooking. You do need to wash off the manufacturing dirt, and a good coat of oil is a good way to start that carbon buildup.On the down side, the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots. There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate. If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove, it sets in just right. But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well. The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them. (These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate) (I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store. I think they were \"storm\" grates. In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove. Also Lodge has a 8\" castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well.)It is heavy, yup. It doesn't fit in my sink very well, but then if you've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill, he does it right on the stove. So while the giddle is hot, give it a good scrape with the spatula, and wipe it with a paper towel. You'll get 90% of the food/grease off the pan. Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest. (In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things.)Also if you cook bacon, or other high fat food, it splatters. Since the lip is low, it doesn't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does. More stove cleanup...While it grills ok on the stove top, It's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker. You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke. (Well yeah)Also if you plan on using it inside your oven, measure first! Not all ovens are 20\" wide inside.(I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true. Took about 5 years of off and on cooking to do it, and 10 to become perfect. Grandma's pans went to my mother so I had to season my own pans myself.

The one that Ruger supplies you with is a large padlock that fits through the cylinder, but you can't close a normal handgun case lid while it's on the revolver. Here in CA, strict gun laws prohibit us to drive with an unlocked firearm. Ruger provides a cheap, hard plastic, form-fitting case with the revolver. As I left the gun shop, there was no way I was going to be able to put this padlock on and keep it in it's case. I figured a trigger lock would be much more suitable for the gun as well as the longevity of the cylinder (not to mention a foam form-fitting case being a must-have). I don't want the off chance of something like the cylinder getting bent during transport. I prefer not to have the lid of any case pushed up against it.When reading other users reviews, I found very few people talking about what guns it did/didn't work on for them. C'mon people! Help some of us out! I looked all over for anyone even saying it worked on a revolver in general. I'm not 100% pleased with the lock, but I'll manage to make it work. I'm here to say that it fits OK on a Ruger GP-100, but it definitely doesn't fit on a Beretta PX4 Storm. On the GP-100, you have to have it at about a 35 degree angle, which the instructions say that's alright, but I'd rather it be at a horizontal position. The grip of the revolver is in the way, but like I said, you can angle it and make it fit. It's still tight and you can't wiggle it around.

If that's so, this works and does it's job.Like many other reviewers have said, no single lock will guarantee 100% safety from someone accidentally firing off a round. And before anyone gets upset at me, I agree that this lock is not a full-proof lock to prevent accidental firing, just a deterrent.It gives me a better sense of safety if anyone were to sneak into my \"hiding\" place (for the time being until I get a full-blowen gun safe cabinet) that this would give them some difficulty in fully accessing the gun. I only have 1 handgun.The construction and \"toughness\" of this lock is good. Now the \"spring loaded\" pins that supposedly keep the lock from moving around within the trigger gaurd are plastic. Which means, if someone were really creative, they could somehow shave those off and allow \"better\" access to the trigger. They wouldn't be able to fit a finger between the lock and into the trigger-gaurd, but certainly some sort of tool to get in there. Nonetheless, still would require some work to get in there.Overall, I'm happy with it. It's not crazy expensive like every other firearm accessory is, and it works well for it's purpose.

Just as I remember from my own childhood. I got it at Toys \"R' Us. Too bad I didn't check Amazon as I could have saved twenty bucks plus tax.The Trike came in a box and took about 10 minutes to assemble. Real simple. When he first saw it he was afraid. That didn't last long. I rang the bell a couple times and his interest was piqued. The next day we went to a neighborhood playground and tested it. First, the trike was a little too big for him. It specified 2 1/2 to ?, but his legs weren't quite long enough. With the seat all the way down, his feet won't stand flat on the ground and with his feet on the pedals, they aren't quite long enough. No major problem. He'll grow. It's just a matter of a couple more months. I sat him on the seat and put his feet on the pedals and pushed him around the basketball court. He loved it, although his steering is going to take some training. In any case, it was a success and he wanted more.The trike is quite handsome and well built. I would j/udge that it would last and last. Some people complain about stability and I can understand. That just seems inherent in trikes. There's going to be a certain amount of bruises and scuffs.

I think it's skirting the lines of legality in my state because you can flip it open, but it's not a \"gravity knife\" -- it holds itself closed and it has a locking mechanism to hold the blade open, so it seems to fit within the letter of the law.The \"shark tooth\" tip is a neat design idea that gives it a VERY sharp point, there are serrated edges towards the handle that help out if you're trying to cut through something like twine or wires, it has a belt clip if you're toting it around as a utility knife but is also small enough to easily fit within your pocket.If you're looking for a good utility \"buck knife\" you might as well get something like this.  The flipping action and one-finger lock disengage means you can easily use it one handed and it seems rugged enough for everyday use in the tool belt.  No more dropping what you're doing so you can pry the blade out or safely close it, just a little wrist and thumb action will do it.Edit:I've had this knife for almost 2 years now and I still like it.  I use it frequently (primarily for cutting open boxes from Amazon... *cough*) and can't get enough of the wrist action on it.

Fiskars is my favorite scissors company and everything I've used of their stuff is top notch - so this is a good combo.I have this knife in the partially serrated version.  It is 8.75\" long when open, 5\" when closed, and the blade is 3.75\".  If you have the serrated model, the first 1.5\" is serrated.  The remaining smooth blade hones nicely and stays sharp.  Gerber 650 &Portland;, OR U.S.A are printed on either side of the blade.The grip is exceptional.  The Kraton handle is very tough and offers superior traction and grip with it's rubbery feeling alligator finish.  It has a notch for the index finger and the butt curves down to fit your other fingers very comfortably.  It feels like a part of your hand when you hold it and is balanced nicely for a folder.  It simply stays in your hand when you want it there.The lock is solid with a lever-lock cog/pin system in the backside.  The cordura/nylon belt sheath has a velcro closure that has some adjustability to it.  Mine is several years old now and I still love this knife.  For this price, it's an amazing buy.  There are knives that cost 3 or 4 times as much that don't feel nearly as good.  The steel could be a little harder, but it holds its edge admirably.They came out with this over a decade ago and you can still find it and it's popular.  I think that says a lot.

The other glowing reviews for the knife are absolutely correct in terms of its solid feel and sharpness. The lock is excellent, and the serrated edge is just about perfect. For the price, I don't know if you can do any better in terms of folding knives.But then the unexpected let down.I took it with me on a kayaking trip to an island off the coast of Florida. I had three knives with me, all of them Gerber knives of different types. All three were stainless steel blades, one being a PFD knife, and the other a full tang non-folding knife.Over the course of the trip out there, all three knives were exposed to significant amounts of salt water. Both of the other knives had made this trip before, so I didn't give it a second thought.  I guess I should have, because opening the knife the next day revealed a blade covered in rust spots. Of course, I cleaned it off as best I could when I brought it home, but there are still a couple dozen rust marks on the face of the blade that just won't come off.So I know that it's my fault for not washing off the blade immediately. I guess since the other two knives have had no problems, I just didn't think about it. With those knives I can just wash the dried salt residue off of them whenever I get around to it. And with a limited fresh water supply (whatever I can fit in my kayak along with the rest of the gear), I need to be careful with how much I use.I guess to me the question is if Gerber can make these two other knives impervious to salt water, then why not this one?Maybe there are others out there with better experiences in salty environments, and if anyone would like to mention those experiences, feel free to leave a comment with this review.

Even when they appear to be \"worn down\" they still work just fine. They are my go-to for both house and field sharpening.The double sided F/EF is a great solution for a longer knife sheath accessory pouch, such as the Spec-Ops (which is 4\" deep)Having a double sided grit sharpener like this is a huge benefit in the field over a traditional stone (especially if you have room for the handles). The red side works as a medium grit and the green side works as a fine grit; allowing you to quickly bring back an edge on the fly. The compact nature of the double sided/sandwiched system is what really shines for a limited space load-out such as in a long accessory pouch on a knife sheath or compact gear pouch. In it's original configuration, the double-sided Diafold is great, but if you need to conserve maximum space like I do, here's a little tip: remove the handles using a punch on the roll-pins. That will take the width down by 1/3... from 3/8\" to 1/4\". That might not sound like much, but it makes a huge difference when packing in micro storage areas like a knife sheath. For my use in the Spec-Ops sheath (Mini), due to the top flair of the inner kydex liner, I also remove the 1/2\" handle attachment area (which otherwise works great to hold onto while sharpening). This results in the ability to store the sharpening system fully flat & flush in the 4\" pouch, along with all my other critical gear  (a big fire-steel, a magnesium block, and a \"smalls\" Altoids tin full of micro-repair gear). Note: the small and large Spec-Ops sheaths are mounted lower than on the Mini model, so this cut-down mod is not necessary.)Summary:if you are space limited but want dual stone versatility, then buy THIS folding sharpener, and reduce it in size as needed.Highly Recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect \"One Sharpener\" solution, especailly for a longer sheath accessory pouch", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2014"}

I have several good-sized old rectangular stones but its been so long I've forgotten where I got them and who made them.I selected a diamond sharpener as I found they work best on some stainless steel alloys I've encountered.  I don't ordinarily use a diamond on anything else as it tends to remove metal more aggressively than stones/ceramic and the diamond sharpeners tend to wear out rather quickly.  But admittedly diamond types do the job faster than stones.This is a replacement for my last diamond sharpener, which of course wore out.I've already given this item a preliminary workout by sharpening a stainless blade that was surprisingly hard and giving my Lanskys too much of a workout, but the edge was almost done.  It took a bit of sweat and patience but the DMT performed well and now that tough stainless blade is a hair splitter.I then used this DMT on some other knives for a quick, couple of swipes edge touch-up.This DMT fits the bill.  The handle fold conveniently and protects the sharpener surface when not in use, but when deployed offers a good size hand grip.  I have no worry about the durability of the plastic, it will probably outlast the diamond.The sharpener rectangle is good enough size for small to large blades although I wouldn't use this for machetes, axes or even a CS Laredo.  For blades that big I'll use something else.Because the two sides offered are Fine and Extra-Fine, this sharpener is primarily relegated to light touch-up.  I have only two tests to determine if my blades are sharp to my satisfaction.  1) the ease of shaving hair; and 2) the thumbnail test.I like this product and do recommend it.

What makes Victorinox stand apart from other (so called) manufacturers of SAKs are that it was formed by none other than Elsener himself. For almost a centuary, only two manufacturers ruled the SAK market they were: Victorinox, and Wenger. In April 2005, Wenger was acquired by Victorinox. Now the Victorinox has monopoly in supplying  SAK to Swiss Army, and to the retail civilian market.I am currently using the Victorinox Forester, and the Explorer, but my favorite is the Explorer, as it is comes very handy in your everyday's work. The most used features by me are: Philips screwdriver, scissors, magnifying glass, and of course the large blade.I am using Swiss Army knives since last 5 years. I tried Wenger (before it was acquired by Victorinox), and I was surprised to see the difference in quality. No doubt, Victorinox came out as the winner here.

{"reviewerID": "A31PDR78F1MNDI", "asin": "B00004YVAE", "reviewerName": "Smaug \"Jeremy\"", "helpful": [27, 27], "reviewText": "I've had my Explorer now for about 23 years. My mom's boyfriend at the time was going to treat my brother and I each to any Swiss Army Knife of our choosing. My brother foolishly chose the Swisschamp. I say foolishly because it is too thick to pocket carry, and too thick for a comfortable grip. One gives up ergonomics for the ultimate tool set.I, in my infinite wisdom, chose the explorer. Even then, before the internet took off, I knew I didn't want one that was too thick, because I wanted the option of pocket carry. That is not without qualifications. This knife is 4 layers thick, so it does look a bit goofy if pocket carried in dress pants. But in jeans, carpenter's pants, or cargo pants, it is fine.The tool set is ideal for the typical urban or suburban person with an indoor desk job. Here are my thoughts on each tool.- Knife blades: Some folks use this as the all-around blade, and use the small blade as a sharp back-up. Others, save this one as a \"clean  blade\" for food prep, and use the small blade as the general purpose utility blade.- Can opener: Works smashingly well for opening cans. Better than the can openers on any other Swiss Army-type knife. More importantly for everyday use, is the small flat head screwdriver on the tip. Not only does it fit small flat head screws, but it can also be pressed into service as a #2 Phillips. (not important on this knife, since it already has a dedicated inline Phillips)- Bottle opener: Works very well. It will usually open a beer bottle cap in one try, and if not, two tries. I use the large flat screwdriver tip much more often, both for screws and as a little pry bar. The wire stripper toward the base is NOT useless. One simply has to cut a ring around the outside of the insulation of the wire with a knife blade first. Then, bend the wire over a bit, put it in this slot, hold the end with one's thumb, and pull. A wonderful tool.- Inline Phillips: (as opposed to a T-handle Phillips on the back of many Victorinox SAKs) Great tool. The fact that it is inline means that it is loads more useful than a T-handle version, because if the screw is right up against something, one can still use the inline Phillips. It also has a stop at 90 degrees, for extra torque.- Magnifier: A great tool, when needed. Some have pointed out that it can be used to start fires on a sunny day. Others like it as a tool to read small print. It even works well to really get a good look at that splinter or thorn tip that is buried in my finger before proceeding to \"operate\" with the tweezers.- Scissors: Wonderful. Probably the most-used tool on my Explorer. I use mine to de-tag new clothing, snip threads, and cutting out newspaper and magazine articles. You will likely find a load of other uses for it.- Reamer w/sewing eye: Very useful. I've used mine to punch and widen new holes on my leather belts and as an awl to start the hole where I will drill a hole in wood. The edge is sharp too, so it can be used as a general scraping and poking tool. Victorinox's reamer is much better than Wenger's. It's sharper on the tip, and it is sharpened on the side.- Corkscrew: This is another implement that some folks consider useless, as they don't drink wine, or they always seem to have a real corkscrew at hand when drinking wine. However, if one keeps an open mind, then one will realize that it is an EXCELLENT substitute for a marlin spike to help untie knots.- Hook: This is a tool that my pre-1991 Explorer doesn't have. However, my Super Tinker has it, so I will comment. Some folks consider this useless, as Victorinox calls it a \"parcel hook.\" We don't really wrap parcels with twine any more, so it is useless for that. However, keep in mind that it is just a general purpose hook, that can be used to pull wires, strings, etc. from tight places, where one's fingers cannot fit it. Just remember you have it, and it will come in handy one day.- Keyring: Not really for attaching to one's keys, as this knife would overwhelm the keys and make it too clunky. I consider this as more of a lanyard ring. To those who find this knife too thick for pocket carry, a short lanyard comes in handy to pull it out of a belt pouch. Or, if one is out in the field, where fashion is secondary, fit a long lanyard, which can be attached to one's belt or belt loop.All that said, I would recommend you go for the new Explorer Plus, as opposed to this original model. The Plus model adds a straight pin, an eyeglass screwdriver for the corkscrew, and a pressurized ballpoint pen for the scales. These implements are well worth the extra ten bucks or so. The straight pin, especially, is useful when paired with the tweezers for removing those tricky splinters. The ballpoint pen works really well, and has saved me a trip on foot more times than I can count. (on another knife, since my old Explorer doesn't have it) I don't use the eyeglass screwdriver often, as I don't wear glasses.  However, it also has the side effect of smoothing out the profile of the corkscrew; it makes the knife more comfortable overall to grip, especially when using tools that hinge on that side of the knife.If you are a whittler, camper, etc. you may want to give up the inline phillips and magnifier for a saw, and get the Fieldmaster or something.Just so you know, I have probably 20 other Swiss Army Knives, and this one is my overall favorite, just edging out the Super Tinker. I also have a Tinker, Compact, Sportsman, Adventurer, '61 Soldier, '07 Soldier, Electrician, Classic, Minichamp, Rambler, Recruit, CyberTool 34, Hiker, Spartan Lite, Wenger EvoGrip S16, Spartan, and many others I can't recall right now.Update, October 16, 2013: Some folks complain about the magnifier being flimsy. It is thinner than the one on my Explorer, but not flimsy. It's just molded out of one piece, instead of two or three pieces like they used to be. Optically, it is about the same. It is strong enough to do its job, and was not intended to be super strong, like the large screwdriver, for example.I've been carrying this knife more in my pocket. One gets used to the four-layer bulk after a while.To clean pocket lint of of it: carefully open all implements, blades last, so you don't cut yourself. Blow out all the loose lint with your mouth. Get an old toothbrush or gun cleaning brush in there to get out the stubborn bits from the nooks and crannies. Close all the implements. Then, dunk it under soapy dish water, and open and close the implements, one by one, operating them several times each. Remove from the soapy water and rinse thoroughly with fresh tap water. Shake out all the loose water. Set it out somewhere to drip-dry for a day or two. Lastly, consider whether you want to add a tiny droplet of oil to each joint. The upside is that everything will work more smoothly; for a while. If you carry your Explorer on a belt pouch, this is probably the way to go. If you carry it in your pocket, the oil will attract lint, which will necessitate that you clean it pretty frequently.They work fine without oil. They just have a more satisfying *snap* when they are clean and oiled. ;)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Perfect Everyday Tool Set", "unixReviewTime": 1335657600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2012"}

Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "helpful": [151, 153], "reviewText": "For many years now, I have carried one of these small Swiss Army knives on each of my two key rings - one for work and one for home. Barely a day goes by when I do not take one of them out of my pocket to use once or twice - to quickly file down a broken nail, to tweeze out a small splinter, to cut open a small item with the scissor of something larger by cutting the wrapping tape with the knife blade - the toothpick is used daily! I cannot imagine being without one. Of course, I own larger and more multi-purpose knives, but when it comes to carrying something this handy on a key chain or ring, you just can't beat them!There are two major (authorized) manufacturers of Swiss Army knives: Victorinox, the maker of this particular favorite of mine and Wenger, a reliable alternative brand that makes many similar and some even nearly identical models. I have used both over the years and have found there to be absolutely no appreciable differences in the quality, durability or pricing of the knives. With so many models to choose from, it probably makes sense to decide which features you need and then shop both brands for the best price you can find. But back to the knife at hand, the SA Classic SD Pocket Knife.This is the one of the smallest knives in the Victorinox line. Measuring only about 2 1/4\" long and about 1/4\" wide, it adds little by way of heft to a key ring. It is a compact knife containing a total of 6 equally compact tools. This is not for the big things. This is a small knife with small tools to deal with small things. With expectations appropriately set, it is unsurpassed in it's usefulness as a basic daily tool.The ToolsThere are compartments on the outer casing of knife - each containing a small appliance. One is home to a small white toothpick that I have found to be entirely satisfactory - except that after a year or two of use, I seem to lose them. I think the molded shape wears a bit over time and repeated use and no longer holds itself snugly in the allotted compartment. They can be easily and inexpensively replaced though at any fully stocked retailer of the knives. On the opposite side of the knife is a compartment housing a micro-tweezer. Because it is so very small and light, it cannot be used as a regular tweezer, but only for light-duty needs. These include, I am pleased to report, removing small splinters and picking up objects too small for my increasingly clumsy fingers!There are three tools that fold into the knife itself, one of which has two uses - actually providing a total of four useful mini-tools. These include 1) a flat spring loaded scissor, a regular blade and a nail file (which, as a guitar picker, I use almost daily) topped with the fourth tool, a screw driver head, small enough to be used for either flat screws or Phillips head screws - providing that they are small enough. Don't misunderstand - the smallness of the tools does not render them either token or useless, but their size is a factor in their usability in real day-to-day life.MaintenanceThis is nearly a non sequitor, but in the interests of completeness, I will briefly address it.Years have gone by before anything beyond simple removal of dust and cleaning the instruments is required. One time, a blade seemed to be sticking just a tad and a quick and very short burst of WD40 took care of it - permanently. The knife is build to last until you decide you no longer want or need it.ValueThere are few things in life built for frequent use without planned obsolescence being figured into their design. This little pocket tool set is, happily, among them. For somewhere around $9., you can have something actually skillfully made that will serve you well and for a good long time. How many things can any of us really say that about?I love mine and would feel not only unprepared, but somehow naked - or at least disabled - were I to leave home without one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Would Feel Unprepared For My Day Without It!", "unixReviewTime": 1179014400, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2007"}

It is what every young kid strived for when then were young and for good reason, it is useful, compact and lightweight, and affordable.  This triple threat makes the Victorinox Classic a truly useful blade.The blade itself came to me legitamately SHAVING sharp.  It will pass the paper cut test with flying colors and will hold an edge for a fairly decent amount of time.  I have had mine for a number of months and it still continues to shave.  However, keep in mind, my use has been limited and only for small tasks.  After all, this knife is TINY.  That being said, we must choose realistic jobs for this knife, such as opening mail and small boxes, opening packaging, and cutting that stray strand of string hanging off your t-shirt.  The 420 stainless steel blade still will dull, but its easy enough to sharpen with a wetstone or ceramic rod.Next, we need to look at an excellent nail file and screwdriver combination.  The file itself works well, not being too gritty as to hurt your finger and not being too soft as to not serve a purpose.  It finds that happy medium of comfort and effectivness.  The screwdriver tip proves most handy.  I actually used this screwdriver on a Phillips that fell out of the inside trim of my truck.  Its a '95 F150, so its old and the entire side panel on the door fell off.  I located the screw on the ground and inserted it back into the hole and screwed it back in with ease.  I would not recomend really putting too much strain on a job like this, but it will offer a temporary solution to an unexpected issue.  This tool leaves you prepared!The scissors are also a handy item included with this knife.  They are extremely sharp and will precisely chew through paper and other managable materials.  Once again, this is small tool that can do SMALL, everyday jobs.  Do not try to cut through a chained link fence with this thing.  Choose your battles wisely.Like most Victorinox Swiss Amry Knives, this tool includes the reliable and famous tweezers and toothpick.  The tweezers are of high quality but do not have precision accuracy as seen with other more expensive pairs of tweezes.  But with practice, you'll be able to master the art of splinter removal.  The toothpick is essential for those nights out at the restaurant after a nice steak consummution, leaving stringing remains in your bicuspids.  This thing will dig 'em out no problem.Overall, this Classic is excellent for a keychain edc knife.  Sure, the handles will get beat up and scratched but it only gives the knife more character.  Over the past few months I have felt reliant on this handy micro tool and do not plan on removing it from my EDC (everyday carry).  The tools are of the reknowned Victorinox quality and will withstand the test of time. I am sure ANYONE would find some sort of use for this tiny, but powerful knife from an excellent company.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Victorinox Pocket Power", "unixReviewTime": 1305590400, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2011"}

She had opened her re-supply box, sliced a chunk of cheese, opened several large packages and cut a shoelace, all with her tiny, Classic Swiss Army knife.The Classic had been her only knife for nearly three months on the trail.\"It's all you need,\" she commented. \"I have to go lightweight and I don't carry an ounce that isn't needed.\"For lightweight hikers, who go long distances with minimal equipment, a Classic may be a reasonable choice. On a trail like the Pacific Crest or Appalachian, you'll seldom be isolated from other hikers for very long if you need help.If you're out on a dayhike with a large group of well-prepared hikers, you may not use a knife at all. But (DANGER!!! DANGER!!! SURVIVAL COMMON SENSE ALERT!!!) that doesn't mean you don't need a knife.Get separated from the group, off the beaten path in the backcountry, or in some sort of wilderness survival situation and you may desperately need a real survival knife.Calling a Classic a survival knife is quite a stretch, and I'd never carry that knife as my only survival tool. But it doesn't matter where I am, or what I'm doing, if it is legal, I have a Classic with me.In most areas, it is socially unacceptable to wear a sheath survival knife with your dress or business suit. But at 2-1/2 inches long, a Classic is virtually un-noticeable. (Don't try to take one on an airplane or into a courthouse ! The Classic does show up on metal detectors!)If an emergency develops in an urban, business office environment, maybe all you'll have are the survival tools on you. And I'd much rather have atiny knife, than no knife at all. A Classic can be an important part of your survival gear.Here's what you get with a Classic:The best tweezers in the world: The value of this is easily seen when you get a sliver in your finger gathering firewood. If you go outdoors with kids, this feature alone makes the knife worth owning!Toothpick: Removes annoying food debris from your teeth.Scissors: Great for cutting anything. I've used mine at weddings, in the office, on campouts and for trimming unruly facial hairs. I've used the tiny scissors to cut bicycle tubes, Moleskin, ribbons on packages, duct tape and bandages.Blade: The 1-1/2 inch blade can be sharpened easily, and cuts well for its size and design. In an emergency, the tiny blade will probably work much better than a sharp piece of glass, broken beer bottle, or jagged rock cutting tool that you have to improvise.Fingernail File: For a survival situation manicure? Actually, tear the corner of a fingernail in the backcountry and you'll be really glad you have some way of filing off that jagged edge!Low cost: A Classic is cheap. In Hawaii, I bought a Classic for $12 and used it for a week. I presented it to the baggage handler as we boarded the plane for the mainland. At one post-Christmas sale at a major department store, Classics were going for $3 each. I bought all they had. Watch for sales and you can get really good deals. Classics make great gifts, and could be a great prepper barter item.Here's a tip to add one more tool. Take a Dremel tool and grind the end of the file so it fits the hinge screw of your glasses. Nobody ever has a glasses screwdriver when you need one!Outdoors, depending on the terrain and activity, I may take several different knives that are used for special tasks. As an overall survival and big game hunting knife, I use a Cold Steel SRK.For upland and small game hunting and cleaning fish; camp chores such as whittling wiener sticks, spreading peanut butter, peeling potatoes and chopping onions, and other mundane tasks, I generally carry a Frost Mora knife.For everyday carry, either in my pocket or a belt pouch, I prefer a thin, two-layer thickness knife with multiple tools, such as a Swiss Army Tinker.Occasionally, I'll take along a multi-tool. My favorite over the last ten years has proven to be the Leatherman Wave.When it comes to weight, the Classic is the lightweight champ, tipping the postal scales at one ounce. The Swiss Army Tinker weighs 2.5 ounces; a Frost Mora also weighs about 2.5 ounces (5 ounces with the six feet of duct tape wrapped around the sheath) and the SRK is 8 ounces, with 2.5 ounces of duct tape on the sheath.Carry a Classic in addition to any of these larger knives, and you have an effective multi-tool set. In and of itself, the Classic is an inadequate survival knife. But combined with a larger knife, the knife will prove to be worth its weight in gold.So get a Classic and add it to your survival or prepping gear. As happened to me, you'll go from wondering what good the dinky little knife could be, to wondering how you got along without it.(Leon Pantenburg is the author of SurvivalCommonSense.com and an avid outdoorsman.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Survival Knife Review: The Swiss Army Knife Classic?", "unixReviewTime": 1354233600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2012"}

It goes without saying that both knives offer a useful assortment of tools and high build quality in a very small and lightweight package. The question is which version should you buy, and I will list the advantages of each model below, based on my experience.Alox version:* Scales are more durable and will not scratch or crack* Solid scales means the knife is easier to clean and dry off* Slightly lighter and slimmer, will fit into tighter spacePlastic version:* Has toothpick and tweezers* Smooth scales have better traction* Wider handle provides a better grip and more control of the knife while cutting* Doesn't make as much noise when bumping against other items on the keychain* Is typically cheaperThe verdict:Plastic version is the winner. The wider, smoother handle provides a noticeably better control and grip of the knife in tasks that are more demanding than opening envelopes - for example, peeling and cutting an apple (yes, the little blade can do it). It gets scratched against keys, but it's no big deal, and I haven't had one crack on me yet.I also have the Victorinox Rambler, and that one offers several advantages over the Classic - mainly the extra tool and a key ring positioned at the opposite side of the blade.

This 2 1/4 inch all-purpose tool is always on my key ring, and is useful for about 70 or 80% of those cases where you need some sort of tool but the tool box is inaccessible.This gem has a tooth pick, a pair of tweezers, a sharp knife, a nail file, a screwdriver formed on the end of the nail file, and a pair of scissors.  I have probably used the knife and the scissors more than any other tools.The knife and the tweezers are useful for splinters and thorns, and thus the tweezers often become the third most useful tool.  I must admit that occasionally I use the toothpick, particularly when real toothpicks are not available.The screwdriver is small enough that it can also fit into a Phillips head screw.  I have even been able to use the flat blade on some small hex head screws.The difficulty with carrying tools is that they can fill your pocket very quickly.  This small Swiss Army knife is small enough to fit into a purse or a pocket and yet large enough to be useful.

Victorinox Classics are like the bulk pens we bought for school as kids; we ALWAYS lose them before they are used-up. I've lost two to the TSA, because I forgot to take it off my keychain, prior to getting to the airport for a carry-on only trip.The two before that, I carried strictly as pocket knives. I even ground off the nubs to which the key rings were attached. These are so small, thin, and light, I just don't notice when they fall out of my pants pocket. I carried them as pocket knives because when they are on a keychain, they are much harder to use, especially the tools nearest the keyring.Nevertheless, I like them so much, I keep buying them. If you are happy with the tool selection on these, they are hard to beat. If you want a bit more tools without much additional weight or bulk, check out the Rambler or Manager models. The Rambler adds a combo tool with #1 phillips screwdriver and a bottle opener. The Manager is like the Rambler, but with a retractable pressurized ballpoint pen built into the handle. (it is a super useful, high quality pen too) The only problem is that those models cost about double the price of the venerable Classic. Since I keep losing them, it is better to just make do without the bottle opener and get the cheaper Classics.If you keep your eyes peeled, you can score these for $10, but only with the red handles.I highly recommend this product, and never leave the house without one.

I've been using full-size Victorinox knives for over 20 years since I was a cub scout, and it's hard to beat those for general purpose work. However, they are a bit on the large and heavy side for carrying with keys- typically I leave it in the glove compartment or tackle box these days. The Classic SD is tiny, light, and slim. There's other versions of this knife that add a few more tools and even an LED light, but I still prefer this one for sheer simplicity. The small knife blade is ideal for opening boxes and letters, and the scissors are great for fine work- you can even cut your nails or trim nose hairs with them. Most of the larger Victorinox knives, if I were to be perfectly honest, have at least a few tools I never use. This one doesn't. There's a reason this knife has been selling, essentially unchanged, for decades.Furthermore, and perhaps the best part of it- this knife is available in a TON of different colors, patterns, and handle styles. No matter who you are, there's definitely one for you. In my case, I have the one with the BSA emblem because I like to remember my years in the Scouts. My wife has a cutesy floral pink one... to each their own.About the only problem with this knife isn't really a problem with it- and that is you have to make sure you take it off your keychain if you go through a security checkpoint. They still don't like these and are liable to confiscate it. This has given rise to a bunch of keychain multitools that don't have blades in an attempt to bypass these restrictions; I've used a few of them but honestly they just aren't a substitute. The penknife and scissors are just too darn useful to have around.The good news in even that regard is that these knives are also very affordable. You can get them for under $10 in many places, and I've even had some given freely as souvenirs or favors.

My initial impression is, \"WOW!\" The Swisstool is really well made and finished. It feels considerably more solid than the Gerbers I have, or the Leatherman tools I've handled. I shouldn't be too surprised, since I have four other Victorinox Swiss Army Knives: a Cybertool 41, and three Pioneers, one of which I've gone back to my everyday carry knife, having bought it in the early 1980s. (I keep one Pioneer in my truck and my wife's car for emergencies.)Except for the pliers, the individual tools can be accessed without opening the tool. Each tool locks in place, so you don't have to be concerned with them closing on your fingers. The handle is contoured so that it doesn't dig into your hand when you squeeze down on the pliers. The knife blade, belt cutter, and reamer are very sharp. The seat belt cutter is a serrated, curved blade with a round point. The cutting edge is on the inside of the curve. I could this being useful on boats when you need to cut something but don't want to risk using a pointy knife. The scissors are slightly larger than those on my Cybertool 41, with which I've cut a fair amount of CAT5. The scissors are nice and sharp.A well-constructed black nylon belt sheath with a snap closure was included. The sheath is designed to stay open so that you can easily re-sheath the multitool with one hand.So far, I've used the bottle opener, to open a bottle of Yuengling Lager. Works great. :-) I also tested the scissors on some heavy corrugated cardboard and they worked well.

I will update this after using it in Afghanistan.BLUF:  I would buy another one should something happen to this one right now and would recommend it to a friend.  I have used two other brands of multitools extensively for the last 13 years and this product is more solid and feels better made.  Each tool can be extended without pulling out other tools and does so smoothly yet firmly enough not to feel cheap or to come out when you pull the tool next to it out.  The tensioner on the back of each handle is very finely cut to produce an individual tensioner for each tool.  The tools themselves are very general purpose and don't seem to be designed for any particular trade or use.  The pivot pin of the pliers is smooth, has no spring or tension to it, nor any lateral/sideways movement.  The case fits well and doesn't slide around much at all on my 2\" utility belt.  The tool arrived well oiled appearing to have been cared for until packaged for distribution.My overall initial impression is this tool strikes a good balance of tension and smoothness to provide a quality tool suitable for general purpose work.  It would certainly suffice until more appropriate tools were on hand.  I will edit this review after the tool has loosened up and I have had a chance to use and sharpen all of the tools. (Update 1:  The carry pouch for the tool closes via a button which I have not been able to master.  It takes some finesse to close properly and if it is hit just right it will open unknowingly.  I've recently replaced it with an old multi-tool case that has a velcro closure because I fly helicopters with the doors off.  The case itself is the sturdiest of the four nylon cases I have owned in the past and the closure suffices for day to day uses, but if you do work where the tool could fall out if the button were not snapped, I would either look at getting a different case or know you will have to modify the existing one.  I have downgraded my review from a 5/5 to a 4/5 because I believe the people that use a multi-tool like this on a daily basis are probably performing a job that would require a more secure closure; however, if I were to rate the tool itself, I would rate it 5/5.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality General Purpose Multitool", "unixReviewTime": 1313193600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A23PRGE14NPEDK", "asin": "B00004YVB1", "reviewerName": "Saint Richard", "helpful": [31, 34], "reviewText": "The Swisstool comes in three configurations, which another reviewer has described well. The X model had the combination of ingredients that seemed to fit my needs best. Everything about the Swisstool shows that Victorinox was incredibly serious about offering a top quality product.I have had experience with several multi-tools (check my other reviews) and the Swisstool MUST BE a contender for the best. There are some top of the line tools that I have never used or even handled, of course, so I can't say absolutely what tool is THE best but the Swisstool X has to be considered one of the very best mulitools available.I can't help but make a comparison between the X and L-Man's Charge TTi (which I also own and rate as a 5).1.  Both these designs exude class. The X has a beautiful high luster polish to it. The fit and finish factors are all \"first class\". On the other hand, the TTi's Titanium scales give it an elegant look and also offer an improved grip.2.  I like to access my tools without unfolding the pliers. The TTi allows this kind of access to the tools I use MOST. But the X allows access to ALL its tools from outside (except the pliers, of course).3.  The TTi allows you to access two knife blades and unfold the pliers with one hand - maybe useful in emergencies - which the X does not. Some have complained that the tools on the X are stiff and hard to access. I recommend using a thumbnail rather than a fingernail for this but it isn't a complaint that I - personally - consider a major drawback.4.  The Knife Blade: I am reserving judgment on this. The TTi has two blades and the X just one (which is the configuration I chose to buy) so I will compare the one blade. Each is straight edged, no serrations (which I prefer) and about the same length (larger than the blades on other multitools I have owned). I like the shape of the X's blade better (a spear point, as opposed to the clip style blade of the TTi). On the other hand, the \"TTi's\" blade is S30V steel (premium stuff) whereas the X's is of \"top quality stainless\" (my guess is 12C27, or something very similar). I will see how often I have to resharpen the X's \"top quality stainless\" blade. If the edge holds up well, it may turn out I like the X's knife blade better. But for now, like I said, I am reserving judgment.5.  The pliers, etc. on each of these tools seem quite good but I have to give the edge to the TTi, which has a true needlenose design. They should therefore be a bit more versatile than the X's pliers, which are a blunted needlenose design.6.  Screwdrivers, etc.: Even without the TTi's included bit driver kit (something similar is available for the X, also) the TTi gets an edge over the X. The TTi's eyeglass screwdriver is definitely superior to that little wedgie at the end of the X's can opener, which will not be able to reach into narrow places (sorry).7.  Both tools have solid, easily accessed and worry free locks for all tools, a necessary safety feature - as anyone who has had a tool fold up on them can tell you.8.  I have no concerns in the area of durability and ruggedness for either tool. I have had the TTi a while now and have done things with it that SHOULD have broken it - but didn't. It still looks and feels like it did new. The X seems to be at least as solid in its construction as the TTi and Victorinox has a reputation to uphold, so there are no worries here.The bottom line is that I am really pleased with both of these tools. If I lost either one, I could live happily a long time with the other. If I lost both, I would probably buy the \"X\" as my replacement (considering the considerable price difference) even though I probably like the TTi just a little better (this week, anyway).In any case, Victorinox has a winner in the Swisstool X. I can't imagine how anyone could rate it as less than a 5.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yup. For Sure a Five.

Anderson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I don't see this as a serious every day tool - there are far better (and more expensive) knives out there.  If you really need a knife, adding one with too many multitools makes it too awkward.  Alternatively, if you really do need a lot of tools, this knife isn't it.  No corkscrew (I actually use that one) or scissors (ditto) or saw (same there when I can find a sharp one).But it's a great starter knife for a kid or as one to throw into a kit or glove compartment just to have something.As a pocket knife - it's serviceable. Victorinox is the official Swiss Army knife of course. This one isn't super high quality, but it's pretty decent. Since the description doesn't tell you the tools, here they are with comments. Let me first just say that saying it has 12 tools is misleading - many are \"combo\" tools that kind of don't merit being called separate items. I had to look up the description on their website to find them all (again the packaging has a nice picture to help you also):1) Standard Phillips head. Stands up so that it is roughly emerging from the middle of the handle making a T shape. Good for leverage, bad for any kind of tight space that cannot accomodate the turning radius of the handle or that needs length on the blade to reach down in as the metal portion of the screw driver is only 1.5\" (look at me getting out my tape measure!)2) Long blade - this would be your main knife blade. Clicks securely into place - so long as you don't do anything that goes against the safety rules in the boyscout (and used to be in the girl scout thank you very much) manual, you should be fine! Takes a fairly intentional (but not unreasonable) amount of force to close. Doable by a child by the way, but definitely not loose enough to present obvious hazards. Comes reasonably sharp, sharpens up real nice by stone. Haven't used enough to say if it holds the edge well, but theoretically being Swiss steel it should? Did not see a rating on it and was hasty enough to have already tossed the packaging well over a week ago. Reasonable balance if holding by the handle - enough for good control. Reasonable utility. Length is 2 and 5/8\" if measuring all the way down to where it emerges from the handle (as the TSA pictures do) meaning it is, unfortunately too long to take on a plane under the new rules about to go into effect. (only 2 1/4\" is sharp though). Just under 1/2\" at its widest point.3/4) Can opener with small flathead screw driver - This is one of those hard to use, easy to cut yourself with can openers that you will none the less love if you are in a pinch and the only food you have is in a can with no pull top (getting rarer all the time). It's basically a hook that goes under the can lid and a sharpened part that stabs into and mangles the metal. Some people are really good at using these...I can usually get the food out of the can in 5 minutes with minimal blood loss. The \"small screw driver\" is a flat bit at the top of this tool. Again, very problematic if you are in any kind of tight space. The width of the \"can opener\" blade will prevent it from going far in and the length of the tool at 1.5\" doesn't give you much to work with past the handle anyway. This does come out directly from the end of the handle though...not in a T like the phillips. Honestly, I'd find something else to use in most cases if at all possible. If you slip, there's a sharp can opener to cut yourself with. Joy!5/6/7) Cap lifter or Bottle opener (same thing)/Wire stripper/large flathead. Well, same comments on the screw driver as with the small flathead except that its bigger and no sharp hazards when it slips. As for the \"cap lifter\" or \"bottle opener\" - yep, it opened my can. But it slipped on the first try - not as good as the one built into the handle of my Oxo can opener, that's for sure. Could use more of a \"hook.\" But it's okay. Wire stripper though...that's just a joke. I'm an electrical engineer and I can't for the life of me think what wire I'd strip with this. It's just a non-sharpened notch. You'd need a wire of exactly the right size with sleeving precut, loose, and not so long you can push it without the wire slipping out of the notch. As I said...I can't think what wire that would be that I'd ever run into. Seriously, this seems next to useless. If you NEED a wire stripper, this isn't it. You might have better luck stripping your wire with creative use of the \"can opener\"8) Small knife blade. Good for finer things (scratching corrosion off of small parts for instance?) but probably less useful (to me anyway) than the large blade. 1 5/8\" from the handle to tip, 1 1/2\" of which is sharpened. Comes out of the opposite end of the large blade just in case you're one of the people who has some odd use case (that I have not yet fathomed) why this matters.9) Reamer - skinny little tool with a sharp blade reminiscent of one half of a scissor blade. If you don't know what a reemer is, go on...google it (using the search term \"reamer blade on pocket knife\". You'll learn something! Basically it's for making holes in material or cleaning up rough edges. The little hole in it is (apparently, according to the internet) for assisting with sewing applications...maybe. This also comes out from the middle to make a T shape with the handle. That's probably for the best if you're punching holes in leather honestly...more control I'd think?10) Toothpick - it's one of those little white plastic jobbies. I've only known one person ever who used this...and it gets gross and chewed looking easy. This particular one seems a little bendy and easy to break (didn't take it to that point, but it seems it would be easy)...so not so good even for something where you just need something stiff and pokey (shut up...)11) Tweezer - also a small little thing that comes out of the handle - metal, easy to bend, but actually kinda better than I thought it would be. Can get an okay grip with it. Would be useful for slivers or where you need to pick up something with slighly more precision than fingers can manage.12) Key ring - *sigh* this is a feature, not a tool...but yes, this is listed as the 12th tool. Seems okay...secure which is good if you're going to hang this knife off a string (I do). Kinda small but I don't see where that's a downside...keeps you from putting other stuff on the same keyring.Also a few more things to mention:Comes oiled. As in, it got oil all over my fingers while I was opening the tools. Good...mostly.Handle - seems reasonable quality, but the way the metal insert (with all the tools) is set into it, it's not the most comfortable. Has some \"edges\" to it (the straight edges of the metal insert and of the tools) that are that you will feel if you work with it. Less comfortable than a good pocket knife that is just a pocket knife.On the whole - not a bad pocket knife at all. Seems good quality. A bit lacking on tools, but honestly, I feel most of the tools a person could add (though I do like saws and scissors) are not all that useful in this form anyway. Quite serviceable for a whittling knife - would be a good starter knife for a (responsible...) child or handy for a generic tool kit or camping kit. None of the tools (including the knife) is as good as the tool itself as a good single item, but most will serve if you have nothing else, which in a swiss army knife is kind of the point.Probably worth it for fifteen bucks or so...more than that and I'd consider other options.  Honestly?

The first one I liked best, as it was the smaller size and had a nice black handle.  It is a great size to carry at all times, and forget about it until you need it.  I did miss the scissors at first until I realized something.  If I kept one blade razor sharp, I only very rarely needed scissors.you can use the large blade for everyday use, and just keep the small blade as a backup, always razor sharp.  Another reviewer mentioned that you should remove the key ring.  I agree wholeheartedly, and I went one step further.  After you remove the key ring, grind down the nub that the key ring went through (with a bench grinder or Dremel grinding wheel) and it is so much smoother and fits in your pocket without poking your leg at all.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that the plastic that the handles are made of are not as rugged as the rest of the knife.  After carrying my first one for about 7 years and dropping it a few times, the handles loosened up and eventually fell off.  Victorinox is making some newer models at a lower price point with red nylon handles.  The handles are much more durable, but the Swiss cross is just painted on and looks very cheezy.  My original, smaller Tinker had a philips screwdriver that was shaped to blend in to the rest of the shape.  The newer ones are just round and not quite as nice.  I might be ready for my fourth Tinker, hehehe.  If they would just make one with the smaller body, with the rivted aluminum handles and managed to keep the toothpick and tweezers...Update: 18Apr2012 - I just bought another one of these, as I amateur welded a notch in the main blade by cutting into a live power cord. So it's pretty much ruined, unless I want to consider it a combination blade/wire stripper. I read the most recent reviews, and was pretty excited that the specs state this is the 3-1/4\" model. Some reviewers mentioned that too. But the one I got is just the regular old 3-1/2\" Tinker. Just something to be aware of.

Victorinox Swiss Army Knives (SAK's) have been around for a very long time and are well known for producing quality products that will last for years if not decades. This knife is no different. I have owned many SAK's and have never been disappointed with their functionality, durability, and value.The Tinker is a classic knife that is basic yet very functional. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as other knives so if you need more tools consider a different SAK. There are plenty of models to choose from.  With a weight of 2.2 ounces you won't be burdened with extra weight. The Tinker is an excellent choice for an everyday carry (EDC) knife as it doesn't take up much room, weighs very little, yet provides a lot of utility in a small package.Tinker1. Bottle opener2.

TweezersObservations on the Tinker:Both the large and small blades come very sharp and have decent edge retention. Sharpening the blades are very easy and come back to life within minutes. Neither blade has a locking mechanism so care should be used when using the blade. Surprisingly, the toothpick seems to come in very handy. It is always a good idea to clean the toothpick with soap and water after each use to avoid germs. The tweezers are small and of all of the tools on the Tinker this seems to be the one item with the least functionality. They are too small to get a good grip on anything. Personally, I do not use the key ring for my keys but will, depending on my needs or situation, attach a lanyard.Overall, the Tinker is an excellent knife that I highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Basic Knife", "unixReviewTime": 1364342400, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2013"}

Mine's the SilverTech version and it looks really cool. The Climber is exactly the same knife as the Super Tinker, except the Climber has the corkscrew and the Super Tinker has the Phillips. I own both models, and am I'm torn between the two. I used to think I couldn't live without the Phillips and had no use for the corkscrew, but my opinion is changing slightly. They're both terrific, but lately I've been favoring models with the corkscrew over the Phillips and here's why:- The dedicated Phillips screw driver is a bit redundant because the can opener tip works well for Phillips screws.- More often than not I find the dedicated Phillips tip too large for most of the Phillips screws I come across.- The corkscrew can be a 2-in-1 tool, since it can house the mini screw driver.- Since there's already a usable Phillips tip on the can opener, having the Climber with the corkscrew provides two more tools than the Super Tinker with the Phillips.- Lastly, in the rare occasion I've used the Super Tinker's Phillips on deck screws, sometimes such larger screws require more torque, which requires more pressure on the tool, and I've had the Phillips collapse on my finger. Ouch! Other SAK models which have the square-shaft Phillips on the END of the knife (as opposed to the center) work much better for heavy duty use. But that center-mounted Phillips makes me just want to get a regular screw driver.I love both models though, and if you're really that torn over which model to get, why not just get both? I would welcome any comments and perspectives regarding your opinion on the Phillips vs. the Corkscrew.Thanks for reading my review.Cheers!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Climber SilverTech - it's sweet!", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}

The dropdown for all the different scents and sizes is quite a nightmare, but the hemp peppermint one is 5th from the bottom of the list.I've been using Dr. Bronner's soaps for many years now and love his products. Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle, espousing the late rabbi-chemist's philosophy and spiritual views (on the unity of mankind: \"We're All-One, or none\"). It wraps around the label, some of it's written vertically, some in very tiny print. It's idiosyncratic to say the least and gives me something to read while I'm in the shower. He wasn't officially an ordained rabbi, M.D., or PhD, but I like his products all the same.But aside from that, it's just a fantastic soap and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world. It's 100% natural, biodegradable, not tested on animals, supports Fair Trade, ingredients are certified organic, and the bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. It is type 1 PETE plastic, so it is accepted by municipal recycling collection. The bottle even encourages you to conserve by refilling from gallon jugs or drums at the store.The soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice. It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly, without a filmy, slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave. I keep a bottle of it in my gym bag.I also use it to wash fruits and vegetables because I don't like to peel them before eating in order to retain all the nutrition and fiber. Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables. The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this (whereas before, I was using Palmolive).

Turns out the soap did, too - it smells wonderful, AND it works really well - gets oily skin really clean and fresh, but doesn't dry your skin at all.I buy the liquid form now for lots of things, from general housecleaning to shower-gel.  It really lathers up nicely in our hard water.  (I don't use it for dish-washing, though, because it does seem to leave a dull film on glass.)  But by far my favorite use for it is in the foaming hand-soap dispenser.  Dilute it at one part Dr. Bronner to three parts water, to get a nice, rich lather.  I keep it on the kitchen sink and honestly, I probably wash my hands a lot more often than I need to because the scent is so uplifting.

The last part of the review will cover soap as it relates to health and some non-traditional uses of liquid soap.A 16oz bottle of this stuff lasts me, my wife, and daughter 4months, maybe more.It's all natural. It's all organic. It's easier on the skin than sodium tallowate, the #1 ingredient in nearly all bar soaps, which is nothing more than animal fat that has had lye added to it to saponify it.Dr. Bronners uses saponified coconut and other plant sourced oils.Lye is used in all soap making. It is a strong acid that chemically binds to fat and permanently alters it's chemical composition, creating nitro glycerine etc.Soap in bar form requires more lye to chemically alter a greater percentage of the fats.Soap in liquid form uses less lye and leaves more oil in a natural state. Bio-diesel fuel is also made that way.If there is no fat left for the lye to bind to, the lye remains in the soap. That is more likely to occur in bar soap. Lye is very acidic. It burns your skin on contact actually and is extremely dangerous to handle.Sodium tallowate strips your skin of its natural oils. Dr. Bronner's soap washes away your old oils, and leaves its pure plant based oils and a pleasant scent depending on which one you choose. Dr. Bronner's does still use lye of course, but 100% of the lye is used in saponification and the soap remains in liquid form.You may have heard that your skin is your largest organ. You may also know that your skin is porous. This is why your skin can dry out, or why absorbing certain chemicals through the skin can be fatal. It is why you can get skin cancer etc. Your skin is a living part of your body. When you use a harsh chemical like sodium tallowate, your skin absorbs some of that. Dr. Bronner's soap can be used as mouth wash.I have used it as shampoo, but it will leave your hair a bit sticky feeling because of the oils. It leaves a slight residue when compared to other natural/organic shampoos.It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom's of main and burts bees.You can't use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily. It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.

For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry. I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present. When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)As a toothpaste? It's definitely more of a \"function over fashion\" kinda thing. Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect. But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that's what's important. Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it's unbearable. For me, it was fine--didn't bother me.For shampoo? Don't use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly. It doesn't last after you've washed your hair and dried it, but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.Overall, I'm not very sure if I'll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling. I think it'd be necessary for washing my clothes, so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me. ;D And it'll also be good for emergencies, when I don't have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something else.I hope my review has helped!

It is amazing stuff.**Completely organic**Smells amazing, but strong even when diluted. It goes away pretty quickly though.**Fantastic for sensitive skin. I used to be able to use whatever I wanted, but thanks to immune system problems, I had to switch to completely natural/organic body and household products. Especially with how hot this summer has been, the peppermint makes for a totally refreshing shower or quick hand/face cooling wash.**Safe for color treated hair since it doesn't have any sulfates which is what fades color. You do need to use conditioner though if you use this for shampoo.**Great for pets too. I checked with a couple of vets and all three agreed this was a very safe wash, especially since it contains no funky chemicals.  And yes, whatever scent used fades pretty quickly, though a minty or lavender scented dog is much preferable to one that just rolled in a dead rabbit. Trust me on this one....**It is super concentrated. Since it can be diluted one part soap to 40 parts water, a bottle can last months. For heavier, dirtier jobs, I add a bit more soap. Best part? No filmy residue that makes me have to go back and rinse mop the floor several times.  A really welcome change for me from most commercial and some natural products.**Works well in my HE washing machine since it's low sudsing.**I haven't used it for some of the other uses like tooth brushing, but I imagine it would work well for that, too.Yep, I am pretty pleased with this soap.  It's hard to find a product nowadays that really does live up to it's promises.  It may not work for everyone, but I really recommend getting the smallest bottle just to try it out.

I love being clean but hate what soaps, creams, and cleansers do to my skin.  I have tried all kinds of storeboughts, naturals, homemades, hypo-allergenics, etc, and just gave up trying to find a product that left me feeling clean but didn't cause a list of reactive issues.  For a few years I've been using \"moisture rich\" shampoos as body washes with results that are far from perfect, but tolerable.When I read about the natural oil base of Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Peppermint Soap I had to give it a try.  I was blown away by the results. It lathered much more than I expected.  The scent was wonderful.  Although it was watery, it is definitely concentrated and required very little on the washcloth.  I immediately realized I had to be careful on my face and sensitive \"middle\" areas, but a quick rinse stopped the tingling from turning to a burn.  I've had none of the problems I get from anything I've tried in the past.  And amazingly enough I always feel physically energized when I get out of the shower.The first time I used it I showered in our guest bathroom, a shower we use when we've been working outside. After drying I walked into our bedroom where my wife of 33 years was working.  I told her I used the soap.  She instinctively felt my skin and said \"Wow, I've never felt your skin feel like this. Wow.\"  Everything else aside, that was all the endorsement I needed.Update:  I've been using Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Peppermint Soap for about two weeks now.  I now have a bottle in all the showers in our home.  For years I've had persistent dry patches of skin that take constant attention with skin lotions to soften and fade, and frankly I haven't been disciplined enough to make them go away.  I have not used the lotions at all since starting with the soap and the dry patches are disappearing.  Additionally, the arsenal of back scratchers I have around the house, at work, and in my truck are rarely used now.  Now I'm the one saying \"wow.\"Another Update:  Using for 6-8 weeks now.  Still sold.  BTW, this stuff works great in those foaming hand cleaner dispensers made by a very familiar hand cleaner company that starts with the letter D.  Don't use a full squirt though or you'll be wasting water just trying to wash the soap off your hands.  You only need as little as 1/10th to 1/5th a squirt so it lasts a LONG time in the container. I tested it with only 1/2\" Dr. B's soap in the container and after two weeks I can barely tell any has been used.  The container is in our downstairs bathroom next to the family room that gets the most use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "New to product:  Incredibly impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1334188800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2012"}

I see a lot of reviews where people could get more out of it. How to use it efficiently is not obvious, let me share my experience, as a liveaboard sailor obsessed with the stuff.I dilute this 5:1 to use in reused foaming hand soap or dish soap dispensers. Instant lather. I can use 5:1 foam for dishes, hair, body, shaving, teeth brushing. If a foaming dispenser holds 8oz for 200 pumps and I use 20 pumps a shower, that's .13 oz of soap per shower. Thus I save money on soap which is more effective anyway.An easy way to measure your ratio is to use a pump for soap and a pump for water. i found MAS epoxy pumpsResin and Hardener Pump Setfit on the gallon jug, and others have had luck with gallon jug pumps and coffee flavoring pumps on amazon. This way you can count 1 squirt of soap, 5 squirts of water, easy.10:1 in a spray bottle can be used for cleaning floors, cooktops, stubborn boat deck stains, car washing. Breathing the spray is irritating.40:1 in a bucket will clean floors, swab decks, clean bilge.Gets bugs off bumper. Gets gelcoat white. Gets baked-on grease off pans. Gets red pepper stains off cutting board. Clears up acne. Diminishes blackheads. Replaces 409, simple green, shampoo, body wash.People are turned off that this soap is runny and hard to use, especially when diluted. Worse, if you don't dilute it enough it will leave a lot of glycerine in your hair, leaving a weird texture. Undiluted bronners will gum up a non-foaming pump. It's hard to work up a lather with watery soap, it won't stay on a scrubby or brush. A foaming dispenser solves ALL of these problems. Even the peppermint burn is softened. Only downside is that the pump head sometimes won't come up on its own. This doesn't bother me.I've stopped using 409, Simple Green, Dawn, Old Spice bodywash, dandruff shampoo, and even slowed down on toothpaste and mouthwash. Lavender tastes better than peppermint.A good companion product is a deodorant crystal likeThai Deodorant Stick 4.25 Ounces.

The top straps pass under the spoiler without touching it, the hooks on the top straps then fit into the slot above the rear hatch. I was quite impressed with ease of installation once I figured things out. The hooks/straps for the rack all attach various places around the 4Runner's rear door (not to the fender, bumper, or other external area), so it is possible to raise/open the rear door/hatch with the rack in place. I have not tried to do so with a bike on the rack, but it would probably work, at least for partially raising the door, though I'm sure is not recommended.

The add say's it's 26.5 wide but when you blow it up it's less which makes for too tiny of a mattress if you're using it for sleep instead of a water floatation raft.I had bought several of these for camping and returned them all and replaced them with the same companies ( INTEX ) extra wide mattresses. The valves on the extra wide are totally different. They're made with a hard vinyl valve that's recessed into a hard vinyl pocket. The valve is made so when you put air in it won't come out. It has a stop on the inside if the valve that's like a flap that closes when air starts to escape. To deflate you just unscrew the valve and it deflates in seconds.I would highly recommend ( anyone interested in a great quality mattress ) the INTEX extra wide.

In preparation for a five night camping trip, I started shopping for inflatable mattresses. The self-inflatable sleeping pads are awfully nice, but I needed more than one so this cheaper option ($11 at the time) won out.As for the mattress, it worked well and I would generally recommend it.  The thick vinyl construction is noticeably better that the thin camping pads you'll find in big box stores.  While any air mattress has the real potential to leak, I did not experience any leaks in five days using two new mattresses.  One possible downside to the heavy construction is an air mattress that is probably too heavy for backpacking. I also agree with other reviewers that the pool float valve isn't great, but I was able to make it work (with the Coghlan's bellows pump) without major trouble.This pad should fit one average sized person reasonably well, though there is little excess room on the sides.  Inflated, I measure it at almost exactly 24\" x 72\".  This pad is probably best for back sleepers, as there isn't any extra room to roll around. I found the mattress to be much more comfortable if you inflate it to only around 70% capacity. Less air makes it less rigid, and it will better conform to your body.  Though not a premium camping pad, this mattress delivers a big improvement in comfort for campers on a budget.2014 update: I paid around eleven bucks for this item, but I've noticed recently that the price has crept up.  At the same time, less expensive self-inflating pads have hit the market. For about twice the money, you can now get a budget Thermarest or Alps self-inflating pad.

Chlorine bothers my eyes a great deal, and I asked my swimming teacher to recommend a good pair of goggles. He recommended Speedo Hydrospex. I immediately went for the adult size, but he explained that the most important aspect of a good fit was the sizing and shape of the eye cups, particularly if you have a narrower face. We then tried on all three sizes Speedo makes, starting with the smallest for children. They were clearly too small, and we moved on to these, the Junior Hydrospex Classics, which I also expected to be too small. I was wrong. They were a perfect fit for the geometry of my face. The adult goggles were OK but a tad too large and I think I would have had much more leaking with them.Despite being an adult, I fit the Junior Hydrospex perfectly, and I am grateful to my instructor for having me test fit these. The moral of the story is clear: if at all possible try on the goggles you're looking at before buying as you could be surprised about what fits best.I got the clear goggles (I tried the tinted ones and they were too dark for my preference) and have had no problems with leaking or fogging. They are comfortable and keep my eyes mercifully free of chlorine. I have been swimming with them twice a week for a few months now, and they are holding up well so far.

Over the years, I have used approximately twenty different bicycle lights by brands such as Cateye, Cygolite and Planet Bike. While some of these were significantly better than the Bell, they were also three to ten times as expensive. If you don't mind the large mass of four AA batteries on your handlebars and have under twenty dollars to spend, the Bell Night Trail bicycle light is the way to go.The real downside to having the batteries in the enclosure is the hazard created when the housing becomes dislodged during an impact. While this has not happened with the Bell light, it did occur with a Planet Bike light while riding through traffic in NYC. The distraction was extremely dangerous. Losing half of the batteries was not fun either.Fortunately, the Bell light has a sturdy enclosure where the top half slides backwards to open. This makes it almost impervious to front and vertical impacts.  However, the internal latches never quite give you a clear indication that it is closed. Rather, you must squeeze the top downward and push forward simultaneously until you can't move it further.Much like the headlight, the taillight compares well to more expensive lights. Similar to competing products, it has various blinking modes as a well as an always-on setting. Due to the design of the lens, light escapes from the sides and top of the light. Such side lighting is crucial for riding in urban areas.The build quality is good but not on par with the $100+ lighting systems. But again, the selling point of this light is overall value. Some of the nicer features include a bright Xenon bulb paired with miserly LED lights that can blink for hours. Unlike some of the MR11-based bulbs (parabolic track lighting bulbs), the lens assembly has two ports on the right and left sides. This spreads light perpendicularly to the path of travel, which is a nice feature when in traffic. These features combined with a very modest price make this light an excellent choice for the budget conscious.ProsValueBrightnessCombination of LED and Xenon modesDecent build qualitySide lighting on headlightConsQuestionable design of battery compartment (top half of headlight)BulkyLEDs could be brighter", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Value", "unixReviewTime": 1163203200, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2006"}

{"reviewerID": "A63F2RIUC2T7A", "asin": "B00005KJWZ", "reviewerName": "remote camper", "helpful": [43, 46], "reviewText": "...and that is purely because I am a traditionalist when it comes to sharpening knives.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and sharpening a knife the old fashioned way is an essential skill for every man...and sadly maybe for the woman whose man won't develop the skill.  Even during a stint in the deli and meat business for 9 years, I stuck with the old methods.  As often as I had to sharpen knives, only occasionally and with a lot of work was I able to get our knives really razor sharp.  Other times, they were only just pretty sharp!Many people don't realize that the most dangerous utensil you have in the kitchen is a dull knife.  A dull knife requires more force to do the same work.  Dull knives are more susceptible to slipping and combined with the force that moved them, can still produce chilling and even life threatening accidental cuts.  A sharp knife requires much less force, can cut more precisely and is easier to control.I bought this device for my son and daughter in law for Christmas 2008.  They owned excellent quality knives, but they were sharp only for the first few months after they bought them.  After that, I discovered they may as well have used a butter knife because that's the condition these knives reached pretty quick.  The knives also suffered from the very bad habit of being stored loosely in a drawer.  Consequently they had nicks in addition to just being dull.  I was afraid that my daughter in law would end up with a nasty cut.  The situation got so bad that instead of sharpening the dang things, my daughter in law would just buy a new knife each year!I used this device for the first time just last week only because I remained as stubborn about my son learning how to use it as I did about my own traditionalist methods.  He and a buddy tried using it...without looking at the instructions... and didn't get anywhere with it.  I learned very quickly that had I been smart, I would have bought one of these machines for ourselves when we started our deli business in 1994 !!It is important to read and follow the instructions to get the best service from this machine. Starting with the dullest 10\" knife and using only the weight of the knife, I drew the knife blade in 10 alternating passes.  This very quickly produced the burr sought in the instructions for stage 1 along the entire length of the blade.  (Normally, a knife in better condition would need only a total of 2-4 alternating passes to produce the same result.)  After reaching the burr stage, only 4 alternating passes (2 on each side) in stage 2 produced an edge on this knife that I could use to shave the hair off the back of my left index finger!  I gave that knife one more stage 2 pass for each side and went on to the next knife.  This time fewer passes...same results!  My daughter in law gave it a shot with another dull knife that would only smush a tomato and produced an edge in only seconds that would cut tomatoes paper thin!  She also got razor sharp results on a short bladed paring knife!Once a knife is this sharp, the machine won't be needed for quite a while.  Generally, only a pass or two with a high quality ridged sharpening steel such as those offered by Forschner or Mundial will be enough to maintain the edge for months of household kitchen use. This is because the edge of a razor sharp knife becomes so thin that it will \"fold over\" in the shape of a J during use.  The steel straightens the edge and restores it's razor sharpness with just a few VERY LIGHT strokes.  The vision you might have of the butcher flailing his knife 10-20 times with the steel to restore the edge is really overkill and mostly for show.  The two light strokes should do it...and as quietly and lightly as possible.  I have even used the bottom of a ceramic coffee cup or the back edge of another high quality knife in place of a sharpening steel, although the coffee cup will remove some material from the blade of the knife.In just minutes with this machine, we had 8 razor sharp knives and accomplished what could have literally taken HOURS to achieve with traditional methods.  If you are not getting the same results with your machine, my humble guess would be that you are not using it properly. the steel in your knife is very hard or they are in really bad shape.  Only as a last resort would I fault this machine.  We were even somewhat saddened when we were done!Remember to store your knives in a way that keeps them banging against each other.  We prefer wood blocks designed for storing knives.  They can get pricey if you buy them retail.  We managed to pick ours up at Goodwill for $2....a real bargain.  They have them every time I go in there.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 11/29/2010This sharpener worked so well on my daughter-in-law's knives that I took one of mine that I have been maintaining the traditional way on this trip to sharpen it on her sharpener.  The knives I did for the above review needed only touch up sharpening and was done with them in a few seconds.  My 10\" kitchen knife, on the other hand, needed a lot of work.  I was getting nowhere on the 1st stage and thought I might be using it wrong.  In reality, the angle I had sharpened mine to manually was incorrect and the machine was putting the correct edge on them.  I lost count of the # of 1st stage passes made to get the burr, but when I did, a few passes in the 2nd stage had the knife razor sharp.  If you are not getting anywhere with this sharpener, you need to make sure you are following the directions and be persistent to get that \"burr\".  Then you will be only seconds away from the sharpest edge you've ever had...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Goodbye whetstone...almost!", "unixReviewTime": 1258848000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2009"}

This is the second handiest because it is still small and unobtrusive, and has the basic tools that I use most often: small blade, emergency blade, cut and picker blade, scissors, nail file with cleaner, ruler with screwdriver, cuticle pusher, tweezers, and retractable pen,To be honest, I got this because of the retractable pen which I wanted for \"emergencies\" such as writing down a phone number while on a walk or trek. However, although years ago I never would have thought of using the toothpick, I really miss it and it was replaced by the pen. Hey, I'm older. Food gets stuck, and the toothpick is there. Can't get it out with the pen. I wish they had left out the cuticle pusher. Pushing cuticles can wait till I get home. In fact, I don't remember ever pushing a cuticle...I suppose I should have complained about the loss of the toothpick - especially after Amazon lists it in the \"tools\" - but I have used the pen once. Wrote the number on my palm for the owner of a lost cat that I happened to find. (Funny thing was that I had my Sony MP3 player with me, but forgot that it also records so the pen is actually superfluous.) The cat and owner were appreciative, and I turned down the reward although I could have bout the smaller knife.I carry the smaller knife (don't know which one, but it has two blades - no pen - and is about 2/3rds the size of this one, lies flatter in my pocket, and has the one blade I use daily: it's either what they're calling the cut and picker blade or the emergency blade, and I use it as a letter opener. The \"larger\" \"normal\" blade I use for opening cartons and heavier envelopes. This knife, which I bought 15 years ago at the Mall of America (well, I had to come home with SOME souvenir) is perfect. Sorry, folks, I can't find the name of it.I'll apologize for this review, but if you can find this knife in a store, then look for one without the pen, with a toothpick, about an eighth of an inch thinner, and you have my 5 star favorite. And while you're at it, but a pocket knife sharpener. (It looks like a pen, but it's a baby sharpener life you'd use at Thanksgiving.) It's similar to the \"Executive.\" Maybe it's a small Executive, but what kind of executive is peeling oranges in his or her office (the executive's \"extra\" blade that somebody in Switzerland must have thought was essential for army execs).All I can tell you is that they packed a whole lot of tools into this knife - some that I'll never use but you never know. After all, I use the scissors once or twice a week, and the tweezers have gotten thistle and splinters and lord-knows-what-else out of my fingers over the years.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "There's One Better Small Swiss Army Knife, But This is The Next Handiest", "unixReviewTime": 1285891200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2010"}

It was a fun, easy, and convenient to ride...until someone borrowed mine indefinitely. Now, as a college student, I wanted a scooter as a means of transportation to grab lunch and run errands off campus without the hassle of driving my car.I must say that this A Kick Scooter is just as awesome as the original I had a decade ago:+ looks pretty much the same+ conveniently folds up the same+ rides smoothly just as before+ no annoying wheelie bar+ different colors to choose from+ brakes on back wheelSimilarly, it still has the same problems as before:- the brakes don't slow the scooter down fast enough- the wheels are too small- no suspension- not designed for the bigger and heavier kidsNote that it's a very basic scooter offered at a very affordable price, so don't expect to use this for doing tricks. The fact that it folds is all ready a good enough reason not to take this to a skate park. Since it has no suspension, I would avoid riding this on bumpy and/or uneven grounds. Even as a small adult (4'11\", 105 lbs), I feel as if I'm about to bounce right off the scooter whenever I'm going down a bumpy road or sidewalk. Also take note of the weight limit. It would definitely benefit from a suspension system and slightly bigger wheels, but at the same time, remember that this is a classic kid's toy. If you're an advanced scooter rider, and adult, or you're anywhere close to the weight limit or above it, I would recommend getting a different model that has a higher weight capacity, bigger wheels, and a suspension systemRazor Pro Model Scooter. My bf, who is 6' and about 180 lbs, can barely move my scooter.

If you're looking for the lightest scooter out there, this is it.  This guy is priced very well and has a variety of color options.  Most importantly, the aluminum construction is light and durable.  This thing can fold up to a very sleek flat size that will probably fit in a larger gym bag.But because it is so sleek, the foot rest is rather thin.  The handle bars are also somewhat light and narrow.  So it's perfect for younger kids and kids who are lighter or have smaller hands and feet.  But as your kids age, they will outgrow this.The wheels have ABEC-5 bearings, which any skater will tell you are capable of going relatively high speeds.  Not to mention, it's so light this thing could pick up speed quickly. It's worth the time to train your kids on safety before you give this to them.  Because of some of these features, they should not be going downhill at high speeds because the brake is not designed for stopping under those conditions.This guy is also missing a kickstand, but since it folds flat that's not a really big deal.  The rear brake is also somewhat *bare bones* but once again probably perfect for the size.If you use this scooter right, it's probably the perfect starter.  For kids up to 10 years old, this will probably be enough, but if your kids are older you should step up to one of the bigger and better models.I have been looking into a variety of the scooters on the market for the Christmas holiday, and so far I'm pretty impressed with theFuzion Asphalt Ultimate Carving Machine ScooterandFuzion Carbon 4 Wheeled Carving Scooter.

I wouldn't say it's like riding on air, but it does make my bike saddle about 50% more comfortable and my sit bones about 50% happier.CONS:1.  As other reviewers have noted, it tends to slip to the side, no matter how tight you pull the drawstring.  I eventually solved the problem by attaching it to my saddle with double-sided duct tape, but that solution only works if you want to leave your seat cover on all the time.2.  The seam frays and the fabric runs easily.  Mine started to pull apart along the seam after only a couple of uses.  I held it together for a while by painting the seam and the runs with clear fingernail polish, but after a few months the seam gave way anyway and I had to resort to duct tape.3.  When it gets wet, it takes hours to dry, and in the meantime, riding around on a wet seat is distinctly unpleasant.  Since my bike stays outside nearly all the time, I've started carrying a plastic grocery bag in my backpack and tying it over the seat whenever it looks the slightest bit like rain, but I've had a few wet rides all the same.So, bottom line (no pun intended): if you're looking for an easy, relatively cheap way to make your bike more comfortable, this seat pad will work, but you have to be prepared to put up with its flaws.

I mean some of the reviews here are a little inaccurate, and I intend to respond to some of these comments.  But first, let me give my personal thoughts on this machine.Background: I'm currently in the process of getting my body back into the shape it used to be in during high school.  I have a Bowflex which does great for the strength training and muscle development, but regardless of what the commercials say, it's NOT designed to help you lose weight.  So I decided to get the Gazelle Freestyle.First thing I noticed was that the parts are very sturdy and thick, definitely not as cheap as it looks in the pictures.  They're hollow piping, so the whole deal is not too heavy; less than 60lbs.  There also aren't that many parts to assemble, however I was not happy with the assembly process, for many reasons.First, the parts had some bolts pre-screwed into final holes which irritated me.  It means you have to unscrew, find a place for them, then re-screw them after you connect the parts which, incidentally, might not happen until the end of the assembly.  It's just an irritant; I'd rather just have the standard board of bolts and parts that comes with stuff today and let me attach it when it's good and ready.Second, the instructions aren't clear and the pictures are ambiguous.  It makes it extremely difficult to know how things should be laid out - additionally, one of the steps is wrong.  It shows a picture of the foot rests upside down, yet if you install it that way, it'll be wrong.Third is a symptom of the second one above.  The steps in the instructions tell you to do things the wrong way - literally, assemble it in the wrong direction.  If you do it in reverse, the assembly will go a LOT quicker and you'll realize that it's actually nowhere near as complex as it's made out to be.  It's quite simple, really consisting of three steps instead of the 7-8 that the instructions have you believe.Ok, so now that the bad news is out of the way, onto the actual experience (and my responses to the other reviews).Squeaks: Haven't noticed any.  It makes a tiny noise as moving parts will, but it's nothing deal breaking.  If you get some regular grease and add a bit to the axle bar, you won't even notice it.  It does come pre-greased, but again, if the squeaking bothers you so much....Ineffective:  Uh, what?  I'm in decent shape and I was able to get a decent workout from this thing.  I think some of these guys had super-high expectations based on Tony Little jumping around like an idiot.  You're not going to start sweating on this thing after a minute of moving, even if you do it rapidly.  There's a reason for this, and it's a good reason if you think about it: merely moving doesn't cause you to sweat.  Impact causes you to sweat, even if you don't actually come in contact with something.  That's why if you were shadow boxing, you'll get a good workout, because you're actually making impacts with the air, sharp hits that actually exert your muscles.  This machine doesn't actually exert your muscles beyond normal range of motion, which is why it shouldn't be used for any strength or endurance training.  It will, however, give you a good cardio workout after a time.  NOT A MINUTE.  That said, I did the workout all through a 10-minute WWE match, and by the end of it I was at the beginning stages of sweating, and started to feel a little fatigue; comparable to what you would feel after having walked rapidly for two miles, but with less muscle exertion.

I mean if I were actually running or walking then I would pay attention, but as I mentioned before, there is no true exertion on this device which would really push your heart muscle.  To me, a heart monitor is more useful on a treadmill or even an elliptical, not on this.  If you use it, great...I didn't even bother installing it, therefore I can't review it.So, do I recommend it?  Yes...as long as you don't have any misconceptions about performance.  It's not going to cause you to start sweating after a minute of use.  You really need to work it for at least 10 minutes, consistently, changing speed and angle.

Either way, I only got it last night, and didn't find it too difficult to assemble just going by the sheet instructions. It IS quite heavy weight in construction, which I definitely count as a plus.The one thing that I can see that, so far, hasn't been mentioned in the reviews is, if you're on the heavier side (I'm 210 lbs at 5'5\" tall, the heaviest I've EVER been - ick!!!), and wide through the hips, it doesn't SEEM particularly roomy when you're on the machine. I DID have a great time exercising on it last night after assembling it, though!If you love elliptical machines, as I do (they were my only motivation for going to the gym, and every time I went, I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get on one, so I cancelled my membership... Now I've got my own, dagnabbit! ;)  ), you should really like this machine.I don't know if they're as squeaky over time as the other reviews state, but I'd assume that they are. Also, I live in a single bedroom apartment, and don't have a lot of room left over to leave this standing up. The main problem? I'd planned on sliding it under my futon when I'm not using it, but everything but the handles will fit - the handles just sit too high up to fit underneath it. It IS a heavy piece, as I said before, so a bit unwieldy, but the wheels on both the bottom of the rear frame, and the foot pedal pieces, help for maneuvering it.If you're not big on exercise, as I am not unless it's fun for me, but love cross trainer and elliptical machines, then I'd suggest you get this, if it's not more money than you want to spend.

I'm mainly a karate and kung-fu student and teacher, but I've done some boxing too, and one of the best exercises you can learn to enhance speed and agility is the classic boxing workout on the speed bag. More martial artists should use this great training tool. I never got to the point where I could mix in things like elbow strikes and head butts in-between punches like the real experts, but I got pretty good just hitting it with straight punches and back hammerfists and could really get it going that way. If you're going to try this, keep your shoulders loose and try to hit with proper rhythm and timing--those are the key elements. Don't try to go real hard and fast in the beginning, as you'll only be able to hit it once or twice before you miss. Start slow and build up from there. Altogether a great training for martial artists of all styles and stripes.The jump rope is a nice extra although perhaps not as essential for karate students. That's because a boxer is poised on the balls of his feet, and his most powerful punch is the hook, which travels in an arc. A karate thrust punch is just the opposite. Karateists punch flat-footed and the punch is from the hips and travels in a straight line, so the karateist isn't always bouncing around on the balls of his feet like a boxer. He's more likely to shift stances and move only when necessary to adjust distance, although that depends on the individual fighter, too.Overall, a useful set and at a reasonable price for the quality and features offered.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great training aid", "unixReviewTime": 1056067200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2003"}

These gloves are almost too big and bulky.  They are like having pillows on your hands.  Now the problem w these youth gloves is that if u have a young child the main thing that you can do with them to give them any kind of training is to have them hit pads or hit the bag. This glove is too big and bulky for them and it is hard for them to want to make a proper fist and deliver a good punch.  You need a glove that is lighter weight and hast good wrist support and probably velcro closure and good wrist support.  This glove is hard to get on, not good wrist support, is too bulky, like a big pillow.  It is not bad quality but just bad design for young athletes that you want to get into training.  You basically want a smaller bag glove that can provide wrist support.  young kids shouldnt really be competing in a boxing match or sparring  but they can hit the bag & hit pads.  I wouldnt even want to spar w these gloves.  The kid cant even get the idea in their head to make a good punch w these.  It is like if u were an adult and had 28oz gloves on it would look weird.

We had Everlast mats all over the place, though they folded into three sections instead of two like this one. Still, it's the exact same mat aside from that aspect, and I'm glad Everlast continues to put out quality equipment.My home has hardwood floors, and I was previously using a thin rug from a certain Swedish furniture store to do basic exercises on, like stretching, leg lifts, situps and push ups. It got the job done, but wasn't that comfortable. This mat has the right padding and thickness that I needed, giving my body full support for everything I do on it. If it wasn't comfortable, I'd say so. This is an excellent mat for anyone who might not have a very big area in their home for whatever exercise they might need this for. Pilates, tumbling, gymnastics, martial arts, throwing, yoga...there's a lot this small mat can be used for. It's easy to clean up any marks, and storage is simple since it can be folded in half and tucked away in a closet or under the bed when it's not being used. The handles are sturdy, and unless you -try- to rip them off, they won't be falling off any time soon.It's funny how when I read that this mat was 'only' 1 5/8\" thick, I was worried that it might not be enough. But as soon as I took it out of the shipping box, I knew it was perfect. This is a fantastic mat and I plan on buying more in the future. Hopefully a bigger version is released sometime.

(2) The smooth material gets very slick with sweat, which makes it a bit treacherous (at one point I slipped over sideways doing a 1-2-3 Heisman... but at least the thickness of the mat padded my fall!). I was also using this mat on top of a carpet and found that it tended to slide around, though I think it'd stay in place better on wood.In short: The mat itself is great quality, but it's probably best suited to certain kinds of workouts.

Vacuum flask technology is the best technology for preventing thermal attrition (keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold). I enjoy my coffee very hot and my water ice cold. When I received this I tested it and found that it kept my coffee nice and hot (not lukewarm) for over 2 days! As for cold, it had ice in my ice water in it after almost 3 days (and I live in the south where it's warm).The entire bottle is stainless steel. It is double-walled, with a vacuum between the steel walls. The screw-on stopper seals very nicely and is made of a very strong plastic, it seems very solid. The cup fits well and is solid plastic with chrome on the outside. Stanley also has a reputation for standing behind their products and offer a lifetime guarantee. It's pretty much impossible to beat the quality of a Stanley and a warranty like that. I am a student and also enjoy the outdoors, and my Stanley is a companion with me everywhere. I always have fresh coffee or tea piping hot. I almost never leave home without it because it is so useful!On camping trips you can also fill it with clean super-hot water and you can put oatmeal in the cup or in a bowl and have an instant hot meal. This thermos performs excellent in the winter too. I left mine outside in my car overnight in sub-freezing weather and the next morning I didn't have time to make more coffee and put it in. When I got to school, I figured = what the heck, I'll see if it's warm - to my surprise is was nice and hot and ready to drink!Here are some specifics on the Stanley Thermos that you might find useful:Thermos:Height: 14 inchesDiameter: 4 inchesCircumference: 12-2/5 inchesComposition of interior: Stainless SteelComposition of exterior: Stainless SteelComposition of Top/Stopper: Plastic/PolymerComposition of Cap/Cup: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: VacuumMaximum Capacity (Volume): 1 Quart (32 fluid ounces or 1/4 Gallon)Country of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]Not Microwave Safe - Do Not MicrowaveGuarantee: Lifetime GuaranteeI must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design. It is definitely a must-have for students, in offices and commuting to work, on the job where ruggedness is required, and out on the trail.

I've not done any scientific tests on the performance of these can insulators, but they keep a beer cold on a 100+ day as long as you'd need to drink it.Another benefit to the stainless steel construction of the Thermos can insulator when compared to a traditional foam \"koozie\" is that the Thermos can insulator is much easier to clean.  While a foam koozie will eventually get wet, and sometimes take on a moldy smell, the Thermos can insulator obviously doesn't absorb water, and can easily be washed in the sink with some soap and water.My only complaint about the Thermos can insulator is that the rubber ring around the top comes off quite easily.  So easily, in fact, that I ended up losing mine while dove hunting one day.  The can insulator still works in the absence of the rubber ring, but the can will flop around a bit more since it doesn't have a tight seal around the top.  I'd almost be tempted to use some electrical tape around the bottom of the ring to attach it to the stainless steel if I were to ever purchase another one.Overall, I'd recommend the Thermos can insulator to anyone wanting to keep a 12oz can cold.

After an hour, both the beer and soda had warmed up some, the bottle of Coca-Cola was at 48 degrees when opened, and the can of Budweiser beer was at 36 degrees when opened. I usually keep my holders upside down in the refrigerator, on top of soda bottles to save space. I also keep a gel insulated holder in the freezer, with the shape maintained by an empty beer can. Replacing the soda bottle cap will keep the fizz in the soda, but if a can of beer is left opened for more than an hour, it will start to lose its fizz and go flat. How many people leave a can of beer open for more than an hour if they plan on drinking it? In the hot sun, any drink is better than no drink, but indoors, you might just dump it and start over,-depending of course on how many beers you have already had. After a few beers, you may not even notice how cold the beer is. (-;In the future, I will update this review on how well the beer and soda stay cold when the holder is also stored in the refrigerator. This item is expensive, but well made. As a future improvement, I think that the rubber collar should be extended the length of the can, to improve the grip, and to further insulate the can by isolating the heat sink metal sides from the influence of warm hands. Four stars for this can holder.03/25/14 Update. Just for giggles, I tried the test again, this time with the holders kept in the door of the refrigerator, alongside the 12 oz. can of beer and the 16.9 oz. plastic bottle of Coca-Cola. They all started out in the refrigerator at a temperature of 33 degrees. After being placed in the holders, both of them sat unopened on a table for one hour at a room temperature of 76 degrees, and the opened can of beer was at 38 degrees, and the opened bottle of soda was at 51 degrees, probably due to the fact that the top 2 1/2\" of the bottle and its soda were above the top of the insulating holder, while only 5/8\" of the beer can was above its holder.Strange as it seems, the beer and soda both did a little better in a room temperature holder than in a refrigerated holder. Whodathunkit. This was not a controlled scientific experiment, but I tried to control the variables the best I could so that I could compare the results. If anyone can explain why this same thing happened with both the hard rubber holders I reviewed on 03/24/14, and these metal stainless steel holders as well, please leave a comment. The hard rubber holders had about a 2 degree difference between the can and bottle, while the stainless holders had a 12.5 degree(48&36;51&38) difference between the can and bottle. The difference between the hard rubber and stainless for the beer can was 11.5 degrees(48&36;49&38), while the average temperature for the bottle was 50 degrees (48,50,51,51) for both the hard rubber and the stainless holders. So for the plastic bottle, it doesn't seem to make a difference what type of holder you use. For the beer can, the stainless holder was a clear winner over the hard rubber holder, with an average temperature of 37(36,38) for the stainless holder and an average temperature of 48.5(48,49) for the hard rubber holder.A beer still cold at 37 degrees after an hour? Hard to beat that! These stainless holders are excellent.Next up, placing the holders in a freezer.04/18/14 Update. The freezer test. I started out with the stainless steel holders in a freezer at a temperature of -8 degrees. The 12 ounce can of Budweiser and the 16.9 ounce plastic bottle of Coca-Cola were in the refrigerator at 32 degrees, and the ambient room temperature was 76 degrees. After one hour of sitting unopened, the Budweiser was at 36 degrees, and the Coca-Cola was at 44 degrees. The soda was 4 degrees cooler than in the previous cooler at room temperature test, and the beer, at 36 degrees, was about the same as in previous tests, and exactly the same as the stainless cooler in the room temperature test. In this test, there was a 12 degree difference between the coldness of the beer and the soda, about the same as in previous tests. It does not appear that freezing or cooling the stainless cooler is any improvement over using a room temperature stainless cooler when keeping a can of beer cold, and at best, only a 4 degree improvement in keeping a plastic bottle of soda cold. I can't think of any more tests to run on this cooler, and about all there is left to say is: \"buy it!\"Sold by Corydor and Fulfilled by Amazon. Manufactured by: THERMOS L.L.C., 2550 W.

I have noticed that the rubber ring around the top of the can has started to loosen up a bit.  I was thinking of adding some glue to keep it in place, but silicone glue might not dry without exposure to air, so I might use some rubber cement on both the can and rubber ring, let the glue dry, and then place the ring in its proper position.

For that purpose it works well.  It's not the perfect trampoline but I'm glad I purchased it.  The main difference between this and other trampolines is that this is based on rubber bands (wide, strong ones) instead of springs.The main things I like about this:===========================* Build quality was a little surprisingly good.  Everything seems pretty sturdy.* This is not just quiet, it's silent.  It makes no noise whatsoever while my kids jump on it.  I was not looking forward to hearing squeaky springs all the time while my kids jump.  So nice to have some peace and quiet.* Assembly was pretty quick and easy.  There is one step where it is nice/necessary to have someone else hold one side while you do the other.  The tension is a little scary at that point but then it pops into place and it's done.  I also messed it up because I put too many bands between two of the legs (make sure there are 5 bands between each pair of legs before the last stage in frame assembly).  I threaded a rope under and pulled and was able to get it over.* This trampoline is very lightweight.  Easy to move around.  I would have liked some fold-in legs or something.  These legs screw in but you can't have everything.Things I don't like:===============* It's not very bouncy.  That's my main issue with it.  I'm quite certain that spring-based trampolines are bouncier.  Not a problem because it's just for burning little kids' energy but I was expecting something a little more elevating.  Just be aware that this trampoline has a bit of a tendency to suck your bounce.  Probably that's good for working out.* This trampoline has a maximum weight of 200 pounds.  I weigh 180ish so I'm under but I still pretty much leave this to my kids.  Not so much for big people.  If you are a little 115 pound woman (or you want it for kids) this is a great trampoline.  A burly 6 foot tall man, not so much.* When it's on the floor it's fine and flat.  But when you put it up it changes from a ring to kind of a saddle shape.  It easy twists back to the way you want it.  Just be aware of that tendency.  It's not a problem once you know about it.* This trampoline stinks to high heaven.  There's some kind of really stinky lubricant in it.  When I first opened it up I couldn't keep it in the house for a couple of days because of the smell.  It has been getting better every day but I've had it two weeks and there's still some stank.  A temporary issue but one to be aware of.

If you plan to keep this in a central living area or a bedroom you may have to have it air out because after weeks into owning it, the smell finally dissipated enough to keep it inside.The Bad:Design: I can't figure out if this is just an issue that affects some or if it's related to getting the elastic bands lined up properly, but the frame on my unit twists.  This only happens if the unit is lifted or moved, but if you set it down and jump a couple times, the frame evens out.  You can tell the frame is not set right when the legs are pointed really far in or out.  I check all the connections and tightened the bolts but still it tends to twist.  The frame is 4 parts to a circle.  Two of the parts connect by inserting a smooth crimped metal piece into a hole.  The other two connections are bolted.  I think the issue is the smooth crimped parts are not tight enough to hold the unit in flat position and the tension of the bands can cause the unit to get off centered.  I posted some pictures to the product image gallery to show these different type of connections.  Even though the unit does this, I have been able each time to straighten it out enough to use it and it works great.  I have no concerns about any safety issues resulting from this problem.Overall, for the price, I got exactly what I wanted and expected to get. I'm only marginally disappointed with the issues I have had with the unit. I have no intention of returning my unit or getting a replacement because most reviews point to the problem eventually turning up, for those reviewers who have updated their reviews.  After pulling out the legs and leveling the unit, it becomes a non-issue during use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I Got What I Paid For...", "unixReviewTime": 1354233600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2012"}

We take it out periodically and jump away. The blue outer vinyl band looks a little worse each time but it is almost 10 years old. The fact that the basic trampoline structure is as solid and sturdy as the first time we used it is a testament to the durability.***************************UPDATE 9-09: My son is now 10 and I have a 5 yr-old daughter. This trampoline has lasted through tons of use. We continue to find fun things to do with it. We have used it on the end of a dock to jump into water. It has been part of 'obstacle' courses. It is great for exercise and balance. The only thing that has given a little is the blue outer ring. Not a big issue but with multiple children using it for over 6 years, there are some tears to the vinyl. Nothing a little duct tape won't fix! The trampoline base has no signs or wear or deterioration and the legs are solid and straight.***************************I bought this for my \"just-turned\" four-year-old son who, like most boys, loves to jump on the sofa, the bed and anything that looks a little bouncy.It was easy to set up (it says you need three adults but my husband and I did it easily). It appears well crafted and durable -- time will tell.The directions say that it is good for up to 200 lbs.My 37 lb son had a lot of fun jumping right away, although he did not jump as high as one thinks of with a trampoline. But for a small, indoor trampoline, I don't think you want your children flying too high. I also think that as his weight and ability increase, he will get more bounce out of it.My biggest reasons for buying it are the safety (no springs, padded edge) and the size. I can easily remove the feet and slip it under a bed.On a really hot day, we can still burn off extra energy inside.We put a chair at the edge (turned around) and he then had a handle to hold while jumping.Safety is a big factor with any toy that increases the movement of your child so we went over all the safety rules before he took one step on. I think that any toy is as safe as its surroundings, supervision and appropriate use.We also have the Jump-o-lene (an inflatable jumping toy). Although we enjoy that as well, it takes up a lot of room and requires a lot of push to gain any bounce. I am hoping this is the next step up in strengthening leg muscles and increasing one, and two footed coordination.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great starter trampoline", "unixReviewTime": 1057363200, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2003"}

However, tensile strength is not how bike chains are attacked. Tensile strength means pulling, and many hardware store chains provide good strength for hauling and securing things against that kind of resistance. However, cutting attacks involve shear and compression forces, and the properties of steel are quite different for resisting these kinds of forces. Many things with high tensile strength will cut like butter.Low security has its place, however, this lock is the right price, but it is far too heavy. One can get an equally low security cable lock which weighs far less and is more compact. Or one can get a higher security chain (for medium security, I would recommendKryptonite Keeper Integrated Chain Bicycle Lock) which has a chain designed to resist cutting attacks.This Mongoose chain is too easily cut, and provides very low security. It can be cut with bolt cutters one can conceal on one's person, and as such, it provides no more security than a cheap cable lock in terms of how bike thieves actually operate.The padlock is of low quality as well, and the one I have is very difficult to close as the tolerances are horrible.

It wasn't, worked as advertised and quite accurately.  Simple to install.  Fairly easy to use.Has a decel/accel (speed tendency) feature which isn't too good.  Has a little picture of a cyclist and wheels on it spin forward or backward to show when you are acclerating or decellerating.  But it is too small, and hard to see which way the wheels are spinning.  Much better would have been an easy to see arrow pointing forward or rearward.  Then again, I don't find much use for this, as you normally feel in the pedals if you are speeding up or slowing down.The plus or minus sign next to speed to show whether you are above or below your current average speed is sometimes nice to have.  Other than that, it has speed, average speed, max speed, and a totalizing odometer plus a scan mode which switches every four seconds.  I found it accurate especially after bothering to measure the distance in millimeters of one loaded wheel rotation.  Simple to input into the device once you have done the measurement. The  built in clock function is nice also.The unit only counts time on the timer when you are moving.  This is nice as it doesn't interfere with getting an average speed or riding time should you stop for a few moments.  Unit also switches off when wheel isn't moving to save the battery.I find it seems to do some time averaging of the speed readout which takes 3 seconds to fully even out.  Don't know if others similar products work that way, but really this doesn't interfere with the use of the product and is only the result of having a sensor that pulses once per wheel revolution.  It also doesn't read below about 2.4 mph which of course is slow enough you are barely able to stay upright anyway.I also noticed it sometimes double counts every few revolutions.  The distance will jump two thousands of a mile rather than one.  Maybe a rounding error or some such in the electronics.  I have counted rev's of the wheel over a known distance and it isn't counting twice the overal distance shown is accurate.  So probably a non-problem unless you compulsively watch the distance readout while riding.I haven't owned one of these before having only used simple mechanical speedo's and odometers in the past.  But this works great and is a handier more useful device.  Unless you need cadence or detailed pacing not sure what else you would want this device to do.

(2) Has the all basic functions needed by a beginner to intermediate biker to track their progress / measure their improvement.  (3) Reliable and consistent (at first) as long as the cyclometer is properly set up for you bike and is firmly seated into the mount.CONS: (1) Poor build quality and plastics, especially the mount, which means this cyclometer's measurements will become unreliable in the long run. (2) The mount is only suitable for the handlebar; if you want to attach the cyclometer to the stem, you have to look elsewhere (or make modifications to the mount).DETAIL: I've purchased 4 of these and/or their Bell twins, both wired and wireless models, and installed them on 4 bikes. After going thru cold winter riding season followed by hot summer rides (e.g, about a year), ALL of them started getting loose in the mount, causing unreliable readings as the cyclometer would lose then regain contact to the mount as the bicycle hit bumps in the road. Identical rides would be measured at 26.7 miles one day, 18.4 miles the next and 21.8 miles the third.  Average speeds would vary by 3-4 mph from day to day, when my watch showed that I was covering a fixed course at in the same amount of time. VERY frustrating.QUICK FIX: If you choose to buy this cyclometer and eventually start to experience reliability problems, try using a thin rubber band to hold the cyclometer firmly to the mount. After I did that the readings became reliable / consistent again and the cyclometer has yet to fall out of the mount, no matter how hard a bump I've hit.Safe biking!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Reasonable value for price despite cheap plastic & poor build quality", "unixReviewTime": 1343692800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2012"}

Keeping that in mind, here are the negatives:1. The attaching mechanism on the mount is a flimsy, rubber strap with eyelets that hook around a nub. Other reviews have stated that bumps will cause it to pop off. While it hasn't happened to me (yet), it certainly seems plausible.2. Because of the cheap design of the mount, it can only be oriented (mounted) one way. At most, you can angle the speedometer a little one way or the other, but can't rotate it a complete 90. IOW, if you want to attach it to the handlebar stem to save space on your handlebars for something else, you're SOL. This is not the case with other, better bike speedometers.3. The speedometer doesn't inspire confidence when inserting it into the mount (it doesn't feel very secure). Other reviews have stated the speedometer comes loose and does not make proper contact with the mount and, again, it sure seems like it could happen.4. The wheel spoke magnet has four little plastic 'tangs' that hold the magent into that mount. The problem is the tangs can actually make contact with the sensor. I was hearing a faint 'clicking' noise and discovered it was one of the tangs cutting a nice groove into the sensor. Fortunately, I was able to move the magnet away from the sensor and it still works, but who knows for how long?5. The speedometer's buttons feel downright cheap, like a plastic toy.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it has the biggest numeral display for speed of any of the cheap speedometers.

The only differences comparing this stove to my father's from 30+ years ago is the color (his is a lighter green), the metal case is a little thinner (which isn't an issue at all...we haven't dented it in 30-40 times of use so far), and the tank doesn't let you fill it up when it is attached to the rest of the stove (which is a safety thing, and probably a wise decision).  Functionally, it lights easier that my father's (likely because the parts are much newer and cleaner) and has burned with a blue flame every time (once it took a while, but every other time it was quick and easy).  It also comes with a filter funnel that doesn't let you overfill/spill which is quite handy.We've been burning the Coleman White Gas which is cheaper and more efficient than stoves that use the propane canisters.  It also burns unleaded gas if you need it in a pinch, but I've heard it isn't as clean as the white gas.The size on this thing is the main draw.  You can fit 2 medium-to-large frying pans on this stove at the same time.  TheColeman 2 Burner Dual Fuel Compact Liquid Fuel Stoveis quite frustrating to use if you want to do serious cooking, one medium sized pan is too large to fit on it, let alone two.  TheColeman 2-Burner Classic Liquid Fuel Stoveis pretty much the same as the compact, it just has a red tank and isn't labeled \"dual fuel\", even though you CAN burn both fuels on it.If you would prefer to make this a Triple Fuel stove via propane, you can buy theCentury Regulated Propane Converter (Grey)and use it with propane canisters or, with the addition of a hose, a propane tank.

Yet I keep going back to it and makers like Benchmade have made it the refill of choice for their pens (my personal favorite and I have many). Why? It gets the job done.I love how rollerballs write. Smooth, easy, and some now use ink that doesn't smear much at all. But you can't write on an angle or upside down...sounds silly, right? I agree...except when you need to write something on an angle or upside down, it is usually important information as otherwise you wouldnt be doing it. Having a pen not be able to finish the last few digits of that phone number you are writing on a pad of paper you are holding to the wall with your knee is...infuriating...especially given it is probably an important number. So the pressured Fisher cartridges make a big win here.For a ballpoint, these are smooth. Some rollerballs are smoother (the famous G2 arguably is (great smoothness)), but at the expense of smearing and mini-breaks in terms of the continuity of ink. So it's a trade off. Which do you like? I use both...between a Space Pen and a G2, you can write on anything.In terms of extreme heat or cold, these do better than most. For most people, that probably is not an issue, but still a nice addition.In terms of longevity, these really outlast the thin refills. At six bucks, they should...if you are tired of going through Cross refills at a rabid rate, these will last 3-4x longer.But where these shine the most is something Fisher themselves do not advertise for reasons I will never understand. The impact resistance is exceptional. Multiple drops of a heavier pen directly on the point will not cause a change in ink flow. Most other pens will start releasing more or less ink to a point in which it becomes a nuisance to useless. While writing in outer space is something I will never experience, my incredible lack of coordination means dropping pens is something I am a master of. These are really impressive.So is this the best refill made? Not necessarily, as great as it may be. Your application will determine what is best. Today's market is characterized by high-performance writing instruments at a cost that is incredibly low...gel, ink, ballpoint, rollerball, and experimental pens all offer different features and one person may fall in love with one more than the others.

I have to wonder if the people who seem to have had a great experience with this toy actually were able to purchase one pre-assembled.  That's because once all the pieces are together, this toy may hold the interest of some kids.  But putting this toy together reveals how poorly designed and fragile it is.  And personally I really didn't see the point once we did get it assembled.One of my nephews received a pair of these on Christmas Eve.  Good thing he got a pair because only one survived.  I, and several of my cousins, undertook the rather embarrassing endeavor of trying, and failing to correctly assemble these.  It quickly turned into a joke along the lines of \"how many engineers does it take to assemble a simple children's toy.\"The unit is made of three concentric rings, as you can see from the product picture, that must be extended before you can attach the handle and a sight.  The two attachments are kind of shaped like christmas trees, but have some small tabs that are supposed to attach to the rings.  These tabs are VERY fragile and be warned, if you break one of the 4 there is virutally no way to attach the handle.  And without the handle, it's impossible to use this toy for what it's meant to be used.  The three rings collapse into themselves if you try to just hold onto them and pull the air bag without the handle attached.Somehow we were able to at least get one of these put together.  The pay-off was very anti-climactic for me.  There's a plastic bag inside the AirZooka that you can pull on and release to shoot a concentrated gust of air.  I suppose if you caught somebody off guard it might be funny.  But how long can that joke be re-used?  My nephew seemed to enjoy it OK, but after 15 minutes had moved on to his other toys.  Considering three of us messed with this thing for 30 minutes to get it to work, the pay-off just didn't seem worth it.  I also have to wonder how safe this toy is.  If that rubber band were to break free, I could see the bag and pully being launched at somebody.I am surprised that others seemed to love this toy.  To me, the poor quality was strike one.  While some kids will find sneaking up on people with this to be fun for a little while, this also seems like a one-trick pony.

He seemed disappointed upon seeing the box, expecting something electronic I think. Once it was assembled though, and demonstrated to him, he was delighted. The air blast coming from the Airzooka carries a surprising distance, and the target feels for an instant as though he's been hit by something very soft. But there's nothing but a targeted gust of air, making this a much friendlier toy than a gun that shoots actual projectiles. I personally was charmed by the fact that this remarkable effect is generated without use of any batteries. The design is ingenious.Some reviews here have complained about the difficulty of assembling the airzooka. I found that assembly was easy, but the instructions were bad.

Box says it is 1107 Lumens, with 7 hours run time.First, you need to burn in the mantles with a match before lighting, this was quick and easily done, there is a YouTube video out there to show you how to do this if you need help, it helped me out and was easy.I only use Coleman fuel because I have read enough reviews that say unleaded gasoline will shorten the life of the generator, and even the instruction manual will tell you this also.I filled it up, pumped it about 30-35 times, and lit it with a match. It lit up right away, it kind of dims and brightens repeatedly for about a minute, but this is normal for for the first minute for the generator to warm up. And WOW, I was amazed at how bright this is!We used it camping the following weekend, and I can easily say out of a packed campground with 49 camp sites, we had the brightest lantern by far! I just set it on the picnic table at night and it easily grabbed everyone's attention who drove by because of how bright it is! The kids loved it, as it easily lit up the campsite to safely navigate and not have to worry about tripping over anything or stepping on something, not to mention it gives them a sense of safety of not being scared of the dark.I had this burning on max output for about 4 hours before we went to bed, and the amount of fuel it consumed was barely noticeable. I have a feeling a full tank of fuel could make this last a lot longer than what the instructions say!SUMMARY: On a side note, this isn't a lantern to be used inside a tent or camper, due to the fire danger and the inhalation of gases, but using it outside it is flawless, I can't say enough how much I love it!

I'd need a magnifier to see the magnifier!); flashlight (seriousy?! How can I use the tool when the light I need to see by is IN the tool?! I can look at what I want to cut OR I can cut it--but I can't do both at the same time!); hex drive w/bits (I'm just trying not to lose the toothpick, tweezers, or pin. I don't want to keep up with screwdriver bits!); fish descaler (Um...pretty much any knife blade can take scales off a fish besides, I don't want stinky fish scales in my swiss army knife)....and I could go on but you get the point.I consider this to be at the top limit of size and weight for pocket carry. Now, I wear cargo pants most often and jeans pretty frequently too unless I'm at work where I wear scrubs. I only wear slacks to church so I find carrying this Craftsman in my pocket to be no problem so far. It is only ONE layer thicker than the Victorinox-Swiss Army 53481 Deluxe Tinker Pocket Knife Knives, Swiss Army (which I also own) but you get FOUR more tools in it!If you're a desk jockey who wears slacks everyday, then you'll probably want to use a belt pouch like theVictorinox Leather Large Clip Pouch Swiss Army Knife Pouches Black 33256to carry this. I actually bought my Craftsman on eBay and it came with this leather pouch and free shipping for less than the price of the knife alone on this website. If you're a woman who carries a handbag, purse, or fanny pack everyday; you really have almost no excuse not to carry one of these because you'll hardly notice the weight at all. At 3-1/2\" long, 1-1/8\" tall, and 1-1/8\" wide it's slightly larger than a lipstick or mascara; and at 5.6 oz it weighs less than 1/2 a pound! Ladies, it won't buy you flowers (but he doesn't do that anyway, does he), but it won't fight you for the TV remote either. Keep one of these in your purse and you'll only play the \"damsel in distress\" when you WANT to and not because you NEED to.The pliers on this knife are, of course, smaller than the pliers on my Leatherman Supertool; however, the Leatherman is heavy and bulky enough that you must carry it in a belt pouch. It doesn't lend itself to pocket carry (except in the pocket of a large coat). So I find that I don't really enjoy carrying my Leatherman. What good is a knife/tool if you don't have it when you need it? So I keep coming back to this Victorinox Craftsman.For the tool selection that you get for the size, weight, and price--this is truly the holy grail of Swiss Army Knives!

I don't whittle so i cant say it would be good for that I have read a few people using it but that's not my hobby if I did though I would probably use a carbon steel anyway. I do cut some sticks to size for marshmallows, Open packages, open mail, I have cut my nails a couple times to with it,  Tighten loose screws if their easy to get to and not to critical I they are i will go get a real screw driver to really tighten that gut down. I do use the can opener a lot though. I prefer a leather-man style can opener compared to this. When I use the Swiss can opener I have to work a tad bit harder for the few final cuts but it does work fine. I Have used the awl to punch holes in cans and I recently sharpened the big flat head screw driver to be a chisel not just a screwdriver. Have yet to use the Parcel Hook....The scissors are great they are so smooth and feel nice they cut very well I was actually surprise how good they work. The blades are sharp I haven't used the Small one though. The steel is fine for me i strop it on my jeans a lot though, but I do that to all my blades out of habit. I have yet to sharpen the thing really I hit it on a ceramic  about 8 times on each side but that's about it and that was when I first received it. The saw is cool works great for the size of the thing. I randomly end up in the woods when I hang out with my cousin he likes to off road so its nice to have. I suspect this to last me a really long time and if I do lose it I will buy another. I don't mind that it's not a locking blade I have yet to cut myself I have learned to use a knife properly and if I need to abuse a blade  I would use a full tang one. I don't try and abuse my blades though and I don't need to thrust it into someones tire or skull a piece of steel or wall. So there is very little reasons or scenarios where I needed something with a locking blade, though there has been a couple times. If I need a locking blade ill wait or figure something else out there really is no need to ever force anything with a bladed object.This is a great pocket knife its not big at all if your used to carrying a folder give this a try. Though it wont replace a big folders self defense ability's it will enhance all your others. The great thing about it is its normally publicly acceptable almost every where. No one gives you weird looks like when you pull out a 3,4,5 inch folder out of your pocket to open or cut something. I would recommend a Swiss army knife and I have.

I've used mine damn near everyday for the last 7 years and couldn't be happier with it. The ONLY downside to this knife is that it doesn't come with a file/metal saw like on the Ranger, but then again the Ranger comes with a corkscrew which I haven't ever had a need for. The handles have come off over the years, but I actually prefer it without, as it aids in grip with the three large rivets on the sides. It may seem a little big and awkward at first but trust me, after a few weeks of carrying this you won't even notice it's there until you need it (like any good pocket knife). Ok now on to the individual tools. Both the main blade and secondary blade are, or can be made, extremely sharp. I've actually shaved my face with the main blade before an inspection once, and passed :) The steel is excellent for a knife of this size and doesn't require constant resharpening (minor touchups will be needed to keep it razor sharp though). The saw is good at what it does for bone, wood, and plastic, making deep, aggressive cuts. The scissors are ok for smaller jobs like fingernails, bangs, or the tips of super glue and the like. The bottle opener/screwdriver does as advertised, tightens or loosens larger screws and opens bottles big and small. The can opener/wire stripper/small screwdriver is probably one of the most used tools on here for me, as I have a tendency to break this out instead of using an electric can opener most of the time. The Phillips screwdriver is a godsend in a SAK, but I wish it would lock in place as I've pinched many a finger really torqueing down on a screw. The parcel hook is almost useless, just omit it and give me the chisel please! And last but not least, the reamer has MANY other functions (imagination is key here) than as just a reamer.

Our first trailer we got for $25 at a garage sale. It was also InStep but I don't see that they make this style any longer. It had a hard plastic base as opposed to the canvas most (if not all) trailers are made of these days.  My son would slip and slide all over. After just a few minutes of biking with no suspension and no seats, he'd be slumped down with the straps around his neck.Needless to say, I wasn't going to make him endure that any longer! So we picked up the Quick and EZ for $80. We were pleased with how easy it was to set up and how quickly it folded down, though it still wasn't small enough to fit in the trunk of our Grand Prix. We now have a Sienna so it's no longer an issue, but my son's comfort was immediately a factor from the first time he was put in it. The hammock-style seat is straight up in the back, so when he falls asleep he just slumps over and looks very uncomfortable.Not only that, but the airflow inside the trailer is a HUGE concern for me. After 10 minutes of biking in 80ish degree weather, he is beet red and soaked in sweat. Now, he is not in direct sunlight so that's not what's heating him up. It's that because the hammock seat is canvas and because the seat effectively goes from \"wall to wall\" inside the trailer, there is nowhere for the air to go, even though there is a vent in the back of the trailer. We started putting him in shorts and nothing else to try to keep him comfortable but he still gets extremely hot. How can I enjoy my ride when I know he is miserable?And you can forget about putting two kids in this thing unless they're very easy-going and don't mind being squished together. When I was a daycare mom, I would regularly take my son and one of our daycare kids who was only 4 days younger than my son and about the same build, and the first few times they did nothing but fight! Sure they were two 2-year-olds, but can you blame them? The hammock seat forced them to lean into each other and make them even MORE hot! Would you really enjoy riding in the car if you were pressed up against the person in the seat beside you the entire time? Not likely!Aside from that major complaint, I do have to complain that the small wheels and lack of suspension make for a very bumpy ride and I also feel bad subjecting my kids to that. Also, it would be nice if you could only partially lower the sun shade to keep your baby protected. When we're going in the wrong direction, he always gets sun on his thighs and sometimes even his arms if the sun is high. We always put sunscreen on of course, but if I'm going to expect him to sit in there while I bike for two hours, I'd like to make sure he's comfortable.So, all complaints aside, the trailer has one big plus. It's price. You can't beat the price, but you get what you pay for. This summer I am seriously considering spending one of my bonus checks to get my son a wonderful Burley trailer. Yes, it's $450 and probably not practical if you only bike once in a while, but seeing as we bike daily in warm weather and sometimes 2-3 times a day, I think the price is justified to make sure he enjoys it as much as I do. Burley trailers come with large wheels with suspension, a roll bar, PADDED BUCKET SEATS!! with mesh on the upper part to allow for good airflow, and padded seatbelts.Yep, definitely getting a Burley this year!

So, I got the XLT instead.Well, this XLT is NOT the size of a pack of cigarettes, it is NOT almost one pound of stainless steel in weight (it's only 54% of one pound, actually), and it will not pull your pants down carrying it.  Hyperbole by others can mislead the investigating buyer.  I'll shoot you some facts and ways to think about things.The XLT is certainly not too big or heavy to carry--and now I question whether the XAVT would have been too big; perhaps I should have sprang for it.  I may pick that one up in the future if I see it on sale (currently it's 40% more expensive than the XLT).  The cost per tool on the XLT is about four bucks per tool, and on the XAVT is about four and a half buck per tool (divide number tools from price).  So, something to consider.Victorinox Swiss Army SwissChamp XAVTThe XAVT is more of a collector's knife, and one might be paying for the display box, but it has many useful functions this XLT does not: more sizes of bits, not one but two magnifying glasses at 5x and 8x magnification (and designed to be used together to get 13x magnification!), clock, thermometer, etc.  Conversely, it also has some redundancy (two exact same package hooks and two screwdrivers on the XAVT--see other reviews) and I wonder if Victorinox counts those twice to get 80 tools on the XVAT.  The XLT has no truly redundant tools, but it does have similar tools such as the thick (i.e. takes up a lot of space on the handle that could be used for another tool) stand alone Phillips screwdriver, which is almost the same (not quite, but so close as to be essentially the same purpose) as the regular Phillips screwdriver on the bit set.Some of the tools are fairly useless, such as the pharmacist spatula.  Some stir their coffee with it, one guy uses it as a mirror (why? the knife blade is a large high polished mirror, the spatula is matte).  Huh!? Other tools would be better, certainly. Heck, give me the other magnifying glass, Victorinox!Many reviews on the build and quality of Victorinox, and I agree. Most of you already have another Victorinox knife, I'd assume.  I will try to stick to a few things you may not know about this model XLT specifically.Weight: 8.75 ounces on my scale.  Size: 3.5 inches long.  1 inch thick if you include the closed sticking out of the tools.  And most importantly, the width (from side-to-side): 1 5/8 inches.This XLT, by Victorinox's counting (and a nice one page guide comes in the knife box), has 50 uses/tools.  I find the Victorinox counting of uses to be accurate, but quite generous.  Example:  the little round keychain ring on the end of each Victorinox knife---that's one of the fifty tools!  Another example: the bit driver is useful, and it comes with the black bits of various sizes, lovely.  See the tiny black plastic piece that you move up to take out the bits?  That's in and of itself one of the fifty tools!  Yes, it's called the \"case\" for the bits.  Please!The chisel is facing the wrong way for the ergonomics of the knife handle (you'll see when you get it) for proper use on wood (the thick knife handle would be against the wood).  Victorinox, please just turn it around and cut the thumb groove on the other side.I purchased the Victorinox case for this knife, still to arrive, but had I waited, I'd not get it now.  If I put a long Paracord lanyard on the key ring, I can have this at the bottom of my cargo pants pocket with the lanyard knot hanging out, I just grab and pull this out easily and quickly.Anyone on the fence about this and the XAVT, don't be scared of the other knife.  It has some pros and cons, and I have never owned it but presented some ideas about it above.  For those of us that carry an EDC medium to large blade folding knife already (approx 5-7 ounces), this XLT is no biggie.  And you get a lot more tools ounce for ounce, so I like that (but still carry an EDC blade like the ZT0350Zero Tolerance ZT0350TS G10 Handle with Speed Safe and Tiger Stripe Blade (Non-serrated).Cell phone (4 ounce).  Car keys (2-3 ounces). Put in one pocket as you carry these daily anyhow.XLT (8.75 ounces) in the other pocket.  Nice overall weight distribution.So, this knife is far from massive.  It's compact and tough and well made.  It's less weight than most Leatehrman type tools.  I do carry, especially since it clips to my belt loop on pants directly, the awesome SkeletoolLeatherman 830850 Skeletool CX Multitoolfor a quick carry.  It's something to consider against any Swiss Army Knife depending on your use needs; I mention it here so that you can check it out, too.

I look at it as \"Mission Creep!\"  The more un-necessary tools you have, the more uses and tasks you create as an excuse to use them and buy bigger and fancier knives!I recently bought the massive and heavy knife which came with  an elegant leather covered box. It has every tool SAK makes. The problem with the knife is there are several duplicate tools added for \"fluff\" just to make it more \"impressive\" and cost more.  And for EDC it is too heavy, too massive even with the belt case.I love the \"Champ\" model and would normally be satisfied with that model. It has more than enough tools for almost any contingency.  It is also very thick and heavy for EDC.  Still, it was missing something -- more \"screwdrivers?!\"  Then, I saw the XLT Champ model!  It has the driver bits I find use for as well as the other tools.So, having said all that,  the knife borders on being too heavy and bulky. But it is doable for EDC.What I would eliminate, thus reducing size and weight, would be the spatula, fish scaler, electrician's knife and hook. These are so seldom used if at all that it insults one's intelligence that a fine company like Victorinox would add them!  A spatula?  For what?!  Cutting your cocain??  Use the knife blade. If you plan to fish you will have a scaler in your tackle box. Use the knife blade to strip wire, etc.In spite of what I would change, for now, I would still buy this knife again.  It is worth it!

You do need to be very &#34;deliberate&#34; when blowing the whistle, but once you get used to it, this shouldn't be an issue.  If it's any indication of how loud this whistle is, I actually made my own ears ring many times because I blew too hard.  I could also hear a coworker's whistle from almost a mile away over all the ambient noise.  When I changed jobs and the lifeguards were given metal pea-type whistles to use (those are a joke, by the way), I continued to use a very old, very chewed up Fox 40.  There's never a &#34;pea&#34; getting stuck in the chamber, and no part of the whistle itself can rust like a metal whistle.

Under Armour is by far the best quality.  It is called compression wear for a reason.  It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body.  I am 5' 8\", 155 lbs. and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to.  If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear.  Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature.  They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture.  However, I think one of the best features is that since they don't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides.  Compression wear was not created to look sexy.  It is serious workout gear.  If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help.  Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts aren't girdles.  They make these things in loose fit also.  Not quite the same benefits, but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt.  If you can wear the compression shirts get them, but expect them to be skin tight.

{"reviewerID": "A1VLY2GSXC19ST", "asin": "B00007E1M1", "reviewerName": "Gary", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Background:The Spyderco Tenacious and the SOG Flash II are popular choices and because I have both in half serrated, and they are in the same price range, I compare them both here. The flash II is more popular in stores and I think Wal-Mart even sell them.I have had and still have several Flash II's and one Spyderco Tenacious. I have carried both as EDC for extended periods in tough use, so thought I would add my experience with them. I currently carry the flash II and a SAK, but carried the Tenacious and SAK for about a year and still have it and prefer it in the woods. I have carried Benchmade's, but they are a little expensive and I fear loosing one. I fly the airlines a lot on spur of the moment notice and have given several knives including at least two Flash's to TSA having no time to go back and store/ship it or something. I gave one to some Mexicans doing drywall work in the terminal in front of TSA screening rather then give it to TSA. I try to keep a knife in my desk, boat, backpack, and a couple of cars. So more expensive knives haven't been indicated for me.I carry a folder clipped inside the pocket (clip outside), with the point down, weak hand side.Spyderco Tenacious:Pros:Solid construction. Feels better then the Flash in use (in the hand). It has Stainless Steel liners under the G10 scales. It is more conventional and probably stronger then the Flash.Good blade steel. Better then the Flash II IMO. The 8Cr13MoV sounds better when sharpening too. Ha. But, that may be due to the heaver construction of the whole knife, less dampening due to the aluminum sides under the G10, and the thinner blade near the edge (flat ground). So even though the edge is thinner, and I have put a finer angle edge on it, the Tenacious holds an edge better.Blade shape - really nice for a wide variety of tasks with a wide leaf shape. Leaves plenty of room to get your thumb against the spider hole to open the knife.Good lock up. I don't like liner locks much, but it locks solidly and secure.Size of the Blade. I like this size knife for EDC.Easy enough to open with either hand.The belt clip is more durable and versatile then the Flash. The Flash clip breaks at one of the multiple 90 bends. The Tenacious clip is lower profile, stronger, grips better in a pocket, and can be mounted up, down, left and right.Cons:Difficulty closing with one hand: I am not a big fan of liner locks, but I like them much better then spring detent locks like old school pocket knives. I pretty much cut a thumb pad off once with a Tenacious so maybe some of it is psychological. You can get your thumb caught and sliced in the blade trying to close it with one hand. Just pushing the liner lock in will will drop the blade against your thumb if you hold it in the wrong position. Not a problem with two hands using the other one to control the blade closing, but with a bolt lock on the side you can close it with one hand and never need to get your finger/thumb under where the blade goes. This doesn't happen with a assisted opening knife as the blade is always trying to open until almost closed.Heavy (this is not a big thing for me, but it is noticeably heaver then a flash due to partial aluminum sides under the G10).Made in China. But, quality and steel is very good in the case of this knife, so Made in China\" is more about ethics and politics then quality in this case.SOG Flash IIPros:Assisted opening. Get it past 5 or 10 with light pressure on the thumb and it snaps open. Great one handed operation, even if injured. A little more wow, or cool, factor then the Tenacious.Light weight. Feels quite a bit lighter then the Spyderco. Perhaps even less then substantial (personal preference). The flash is all plastic actually glass-reinforced nylon (GRN). It has some kind of metal bushing between the blade and (GRN) sides.Size of the Blade. I like this size knife for EDC.Lock up is solid, as far as staying open/not closing. There is a little slop though when open in both directions. I have never tried to tighten it up. I have never worried about it closing on me in use.Safety. You can lock it so it wont open in your pocket.Easy to sharpen.Made in USACon's:Slop when open. Not bad, but not as tight as the Tenacious.Safety - I have had it come open in my pocket a couple of times in active situations. It wasn't locked when this happened. Pretty scary. I knew it was open, or partially open; in one case when I reached in my pocket and cut a fingers, and two other times when I felt the point sticking into the front of my hip. In the later two I stopped moving and then moved real slowly until I got it folded back up and under control. Front pocket, bad place for an open knife. For some reason a Benchmade Barrage assisted open has never come open in my pocket (even unlocked). Of course the Benchmade is a great knife, but at more then twice the cost. I think the flash lacks a tendency to stay closed. Better spring assisted knives seem to have more force toward closed until you pass the point where it springs toward open. It's not like the safety is a plus, so much as it is just plain needed, because of the tenancy to come open if the thumb nut is bumped in the pocket. However, the safety will come off, or turn on, in pocket. This further aggravates the above problem.Steel is softer then Tenacious and doesn't hold an edge nearly as well. Easy to ding and dull the edge. Supposed to be AUS-8, 56-58 Rockwell (same hardness as Tenacious's Chinese 8Cr13MoV, but I perceive all three Flashes to be softer than and not hold an edge as well as the Tenacious based on use and response when sharpening ).I have broken 2 belt clips. SOG replaced them for free though. There is a place on there web sight for this.Belt clip can be mounted for left or right but not up or down. It only mounts for point down (that is it will be point down if opened).Fairly complicated to disassemble if needed to clean. Goes with the territory for an assisted.The glass-reinforced nylon (GRN) frame may feel cheap to some. It doesn't have any metal liners, but is very strong and works well.Summary:I like both knives for different reasons.I give the edge to the Tenacious for the Blade design & hardness, build construction, and belt clip. Opening is good and easy but requires moving the blade all the way open, or a strong flip on a well broken in knife.The Flash II is lighter (may be good or bad). I like the bolt action lock better, mainly for ease of closing with one hand, and the spring assist opening it great. The flash has more pzazz.Both knives are about the same price $30 to $45 depending on options and seller at the time of this post, with the Spyderco starting on the lower end of the overlap price range and the Flash topping out the range.A cross between these with the Spyderco blade design and steel, assisted opening and an axis type lock like the Flash, would be real cool. Better then either one IMO. My Benchmade Barrage is the best of both worlds or better, and I like it better (who wouldn't), but too expensive for EDC for me.Conclusion:Even though this is my EDC knife, I have to say the Spyderco Tenacious may be the more practical and possibly a better choice for most applications. It has better steel, seems to be stronger, better blade shape, etc. I still carry the flash because of the assist, weight, and the safety issues. It's almost like it's not there.Best choice is to get them both.Hope this helps someone decide.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My current EDC knife.", "unixReviewTime": 1385337600, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2013"}

SOG has also added jimping to the finger groove area to get a better grip. A couple of things I do not like about this knife is the blade play from right to left when opened and in the locked position, you can tighten the pivot screw to get rid of this play. Also there is blade play up and down just slightly when in the locked position (can't do much about that). Finally SOG put's an electronic anti-theft stick plate on the inside of the handle which can be removed if you take the handle apart.

I wanted and could have got it about $10 cheaper with the plain blade(which I much prefer)on amazon but I was itching to buy a new knife(ever happen to you?)so i bought this one with the serrated blade.The knife came in a clampack/lockbar combo that was unpleasantly tedious to remove the knife Ifrom but well protected from damage of any kind. The fact that a lot of cheap chinese made knives come wrapped in tissue and in nice boxes and a knife like this doesn't really chaps my arse but it is what it is.At first feel this knife can come across \"plasticky\" due to the handle design and material used but that quickly goes out the window after carrying and using this knife for awhile. It is textured but I would not call it grippy although the shape of the handle does feel solid and secure in my large hands. A weak attempt at jimping on the top and choil area of the handle is appreciated but disappointing. The handle is liner-less to reduce weight but this knife is strong and rigid. This knife is light for its size making it great for edc purposes. The pocket clip designs on these SOG's is the best in my opinion as the knives totally disappear into your pocket.The quality blade is razor sharp out of the package on mine and is a decent steel(AUS 8 or equivalent I believe). I don't like serrations myself but these did make short work out of rope and cord. The blade is beautiful and the SOG Flash II logo looks cool on the blade but the patent # on the other side is kind of lame. This is a USA made knife as is my SOG Trident but it is displayed nowhere on the knives themselves which really steams my clams if you know what I mean. The thumbstuds are of good design and are not too smooth nor too rough and a slight push causes the blade to really fly open.The action on this knife is awesome and fun to deploy repeatedly. Zero blade play in this example but after about 200-300 openings and closings it developed slight left to right but very slight so a minor adjustment to the pivot screw and it is back to being solid and fast. I love the sound it makes as it locks up! The arc lock is simple and safe and grows on you after awhile. The safety lock is a cool idea but as most have stated it can be tedious after repeated usage. Even unlocked I do not fear it opening in my pocket on accident.Overall this knife is the one if you have medium to large hands because for me the Flash I is just too small.

Knife is aus 8 which is decent steel, factory sharp, fairly thick steel.Pros:Steel is good quality for this price point of knife.  Much more durable (as far as holding an edge) than similar chinese kershaw 8cr13mov.  This isn't a chinese knife but it's an \"assembled\" in the US.  Based on the steel my guess is this is primarily taiwan (for the steel) and/or chinese for the rest.  Chinese knives are usually 8cr13 or 8cr14 that's why I say this.  Taiwan metal working is actually pretty good when it comes to tools nowadays (about 90% of professional American metal work with similar materials) so there's no real problem with it.Safety is great, works, and you will use it because of the action.Handle is well designed for non-optimal condition use (i.e. grease, soil, water, etc).Cons:Clip design isn't great for removing the knife from a pocket (have to grip the knife oddly to remove it).The \"assisted\" action of the knife is way too fast for this type of knife.  I'm not saying that it's dangerous but it has the potential to be if you're not paying attention.Blade lock is a bit goofy, it doesn't really lock in place when the blade is deployed.Altogether for the money I paid (20 bucks), this is a great knife.  Though the design doesn't match the proposed function.  This is supposed to be a general use (actually \"contractor grade\" from the package) knife and it's a bit too pseudo-tactical for my tastes.  I'd still give it 4.5 stars because it's well made, lifetime warranty, and the price was right.  For this price range (20-40) you won't be able to do any better and this is a full featured knife in my opinion.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic knife but some issues (4.5 stars)", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2013"}

I have several assisted open folders (mostly Kershaw) and I had heard and read good things about SOG knives, so I decided to make this my first SOG knife - I haven't been disappointed.First, my EDC is the Kershaw Blur without the serrated edge. The Blur is my favorite knife and I consider it the best value of any knife I own.  This knife compares favorably to the Blur. I still prefer the Kershaw Blur, but both knives are excellent choices and represent great value. Many of my comments will compare / contrast this knife to the Blur.Pros:Assisted open is very good - every bit as good as the Blur.Locking mechanism in the handle to prevent the blade from being opened if engaged. At first I didn't like this feature, but I think it is probably a good feature for many people.Good blade. The blade came extremely sharp and it is pretty easy to sharpen.Solidly built. The locking mechanism is good and the blade doesn't have any extra side to side play when blade is extended.The clip works well. Some folder's clips are too tight, but I like this clip. It is easy to slide over my pocket edge and it keeps the knife secure. The clip is actually better than the Blur's.I like the grip. Good shape and doesn't slip in your hand.Not too heavy.Cons:Closing the knife is a little more difficult than my Kershaws. There seems to be more resistance after the blade is halfway closed. Just not as smooth closing as I'd likeThe blade is good - very sharp and solid - but the Blur's blade is a little sturdier IMO.Summary:This is really a good knife and, at the Amazon price, a great value.

Very inexpensive and also very high quality, I can't recommend them enough.Anyway, I LOVE this knife, and I'm sure you will too at this price point!You'll notice some bad reviews on the sheath - however take note of how old the reviews are, they are from the first version of this knife which had an overly long choil and less of a cutting edge due to more serrations, and apparently a weird sheath.

I received the newer version with the thankfully shorter finger choil and steel upgrade (AUS-8 instead of AUS-6). While I don't mind AUS-8 at this price point I will say I don't like it in this knife. The first time I used it the blade chipped in multiple places just from hacking off light kindling. Therefore, I would never \"hard use\" this knife. The clip point blade is ideal for thrusting soft materials but the very tip of mine has already broken off somehow which I am going to blame on the steel and thin tip thickness because I really haven't abused this knife. Maybe it was a bad batch of steel or maybe it was poor treatment of it by SOG. The serrations are decent for cutting rope and chord and there is enough belly that there is still a lot of plain edge to work with. The finish also comes of pretty easily which is bad because this steel rusts if not cared for (ie. used in a survival scenario). The handle is well textured on the sides and shaped for medium to large sized hands. The recess for your thumb on the spine is awkward because of the flared guard and really needs to be jimped to work well in my opinion. The steel also looses its edge pretty quickly so I wouldn't use it for hunting and skinning but it is easy to sharpen. I got the nylon sheath and it is not of the highest quality on terms of stitching and I would recommend getting the Kydex version.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not the Best", "unixReviewTime": 1367280000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2013"}

The handle is easy to use with gloves on in the cold, and the handle is not hard to use without gloves, the non slop surface provides for an excellent grip even when wet.  This is a very functional knife and if I lived in an area where it was moist or constantly wet and rainy there is no doubt that this knife would be my first choice to carry.  I bought the knife as a backup but and am not disappointed with it.  I would recommend the SOG to a friend.  This knife will replace the K-bar for fishing around the lake and from the boat because I can use a lanyard with it to prevent loss of the knife in the water.  I like the nylon sheath because it will dry quickly if wet.  the only negative that I have found is the velcro knife retainer on the sheath.

(I kept track.) I travel as light as I can and every ounce counts. Any other fixed-blade must deliver a lot a performance for its weight before I would even consider carrying it.I explain all this because the SOG Seal knife is one of the very few I would not hesitate to take with me on a long trip to the middle of nowhere.There are many reasons to buy a knife, I know, but performance is what I care about. How much muscle does it take to get a fixed-blade to cut, chop, slice and split? The SOG requires less effort to use than most other fixed blades I own, and the ones that can match it are heavier. Among blades of this length, the SOG Seal is the champ. None perform better.I attribute this largely to its thick-spined hollow-ground cross section. Compared to many knives, the SOG's edge is thinner. If you want a knife to sink into something, thinner goes in easier than thicker. If I had to pry apart masonry and steel doors after an apocalypse, maybe I'd choose something else. In the woods, however, I know it won't fail.I guess it was sharp enough out of the box, but that's something I never pay attention to because I will sharpen a knife the way I want it to be. With the SOG Seal's blade, it was easy to do.I chose this over the Elite, btw, because this has no rasp on the back. On my Seal Pup Elite, that rasp is pretty much useless except on green wood. I assume the Seal Team Elite rasp is no different.Some might say the SOG Seal's handle could be better, the cutting edge could be longer and a fine edge would be better than the serrations.

The other reason is that since it is made of cast iron you always have to hand wash it and wipe it dry to store. Other wise next time you need it you will be scraping off rust spots from the griddle. It also takes some time to reach a consistent temperature, so if I'm just making one quick omelet or fried egg I still bring out the old teflon. You may ask why would I deduct a star for these reasons as these points would apply to any cast iron cookware, but these factors make it a little less convenient to use this griddle often. And it loses a point when compared with other non-cast iron cookware.Overall though, this griddle is an invaluable addition to my kitchen, especially for my Indian breads.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Heavy base is great for omelettes and tortillas but handwash and keep from rusting!", "unixReviewTime": 1168473600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2007"}

My only complaint is that the burners on my stove aren't large enough to heat it properly.  However, since it's cast iron, that simply means that I need to give it a few extra minutes of heating time.  And it does heat uniformly given that few extra minutes even though my burners are at fault.That was my biggest reason why I desired a cast iron skillet in the first place.  Because the metal one I have just didn't retain heat.  It didn't matter how long I left it on the burner, the edges would not heat up.But cast iron has nice heat convection properties which means that I can make uniform pancakes every time.Ideally, even if only cooking three pancakes on this griddle, they will come out quite small.

Khannah-Brown\"", "helpful": [10, 12], "reviewText": "*****This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line in every way.  The designs of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles (like this one), to others with intricate designs. I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, even though I thought a permanent bottle like this would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning less of a chore. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design.Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap. They do dent if dropped on a hard surface at a particular angle, but Sigg fans (including me) view this as a type of \"seasoning\", so that your bottle acquires character. The dents are on the outside layer of the bottle, not the inside layer and so don't interfere with any functionality.Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. This bottle has a screw top, which I prefer.  I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leak proof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabineer. If you ever lose the top, you can buy them separately.Sigg makes their personal water bottle in many sizes. I use the .6L size as my basic every day size, and keep it in my briefcase. It is a bit too large for my purse, although if you carry a tote it is an ideal size. It is also good for sports activities that require less water, like shorter walks. For my car and other uses I use the larger 1L size.This bottle may seem expensive, but it is so durable that you can plan on it lasting many years.

My assessment.Battery access is downright painful.  From a comment I read, the newer models may have a pry slot on the side for removing the ear pads for battery change.  Mine don't, but I'm considering carving one out.Noise reduction is not that great.  Get next to someone shooting a magnum pistol at the range, and you will feel pain.  I've finally gone to Tom Gresham's method of wearing both foam earplugs and these.  In combination the noise reduction is very good, and with the built-in amplifier, you can still hear conversation and range announcements.The good.  Nice OD color.  The headband fits over a baseball cap and shooting glasses.  Folded for storage, they are very compact.Wish list.  It would be great if they came with built-in Lithium Ion batteries and charger connector.  The battery removal problem would go away, and Lithium Ion batteries don't have the problem of a high self-discharge rate in storage.All things considered, I cannot recommend these even at the excellent amazon.com price (which is way less than I paid elsewhere several years ago.)Added.  Yes, I know the pro models from Peltor are from two to three times the price of these, and if those are my only other choices, then this model does make sense.

I bought them in early 2013 during a great sale, and scored three sets for $110 (total) shipped. 3M Peltor is arguably the most recognizeable name in Ear Pro, so I was confident that these things would fit the bill, instead of opting for Leight's or far more expensive alternatives.Sadly, they're barely worth the $37 I paid for them. Yes, they work satisfactorily at isolating gunfire noise and certainly keep your ears safe. That's about where the performance ends. I have other sets, including cheaper ones, that perform every bit as well at isolating the unwanted sounds. The difference comes in the sounds you actually WANT to hear. All three sets of the Peltor 6S' that I have perform identically, so I'm satisfied that my sample is reasonably representative of the whole. With the Peltor's, ambient sounds, including voices, etc, are dull and much of the surrounding noise isn't discernible at all -- even when turned ALL the way up. With virtually all of my other sets, including the Howard Leight sets, I can hear MUCH better than with the naked ear. All ambient noises are amplified while completely tuning out loud / harmful noises. This is great when you're out in the woods, or on a range where you need to hear the Marshall's instructions. In the woods, I can hear squirrels munching on nuts or crawling around in the trees, and even field mice under ground cover. None of these sounds are heard when using the Peltors.The battery design was conceived by Rube Goldberg himself. I mean, seriously 3M -- why?! The plastic construction feels very cheap, and the posts that connect the headgear to the muffs seem to scream &#34;break me!&#34; I don't mind plastic / &#34;polymer&#34; at all, and many things made from plastic materials are very robust and nearly indestructible, however these Peltors don't inspire confidence in their potential durability. The muffs / cups themselves also feel very cheaply made, but they do make a seal sufficient enough to block harmful noise.So, in a nutshell, these muffs &#34;work&#34;, but they're barely satisfactory. I have a $20 set of cheap Caldwell's that run circles around these Peltors, and the Howard Leights are in another universe by comparison, for a small premium over the 3Ms.My personal recommendation is, in this price range, go with something else, or step up to more expensive Ear Pro. I have a set of 3M ComTac III's and they're insanely good -- perhaps the best-ever -- but at $600 you'd expect them to be.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cheap price. Cheaply built.

This year I had so much trouble hunting.  I shoot a 7 mag, thats a loud mother but I always want to be able to hear. In the past I have kept my muffs pulled up above my ear slightly.  Problem there is, it starts to hurt your ear, it bends the ear's natural fold to where I can only hear whats directly beside me and you run the risk of scaring game when repositioning them. My fiance has sat with me to be extra eyes and ears and she wore no muffs, luckily I never took a shot.All those problems made me finally break down and say I'm going a new route.  I'm so pleased with the 97044s.  They look sleak, they feel sturdy and they fold up to a compact size.  They fit comfortable and tight.  The amplification of my hearing ability is awesome!  A real upper hand when hunting.  Battery life seems to be decent too.  I will agree with the review that said battery placement and changing is difficult and could have been better designed, but I've got it down now, so no more problems there.As for the dB rating, I can believe it.  When I first put them on, I did a series of hand claps and other noises in front of the mics.  Cut right out just as promised.  Confident with it I shot my 7 and my PLR-16 (which is ungodly loud with a muzzle break) and 100% satisfaction.  I've seen some reviews saying that the 97044s did not work well, I'm going to contribute it to maybe Peltor isn't consistant with product quality?As for the delay time after the cut out, who cares?  I don't take a shot and then carry on an important conversation immediately.  There is a few seconds delay but I mean come on, for general usage, is that really a problem?  It does not bother me in the least bit.I'm no expert on shooting muffs, but my range junkie buddies tell me there is a lot better quality protection out, but for the price these are outstanding muffs.

I concurr with current reviewers on this major point.I bought a set for my 11 year old for a shooting kit to go with his new Henry Golden Boy.I've had a previous generation set for years and mostly like them for the audio and protection and slimness. And knowing the negatives of the somewhat difficult to change batteries and the exposed knobs often turning them on in the bag - with no auto-off - killing the batteries (thus getting into difficult to change batteries).But I ordered a set for my 11 year old because I knew them well and he really liked the fit and feel.I could immediately tell they were newer - the plastic moulding is (acceptably) different. I could not, without fear of wrecking the ear pads with excessive force, remove them to put in the batteries. Period. Pads would not come off without risk of damaging the pads. I trued the usual grips and angles I use on mine that help - but nope. So while I figured he'd have difficulty and need my help on batteries - I wasn't expecting myself, an experienced user of these, to find it impossible to access the batteries.So when 3M bought this from Peltor - they ruined them. Poor quality control on fit and finish of pads and battery access make these unusable.At the time I bought mine years ago - these were both the best and only in their class. That is not so now. Knowing the possibility I had also ordered and tried Howard Leight. Those my older son and I really like - but their rectangular pads won't cover the lower back corner of my 11 year old's ear/head. So I'm still searching for something for him. I may give him my older generation Peltor Tactical 6S and get Howard Leights or another perhaps higher end model for myself to replace them.EDIT 3/18: Compared against Howard Leight's . The Audio is crisper than the Howard Leight's. No \"spacey\" sound. The Peltors didn't have as much gain (volume). The Howard's only had that \"spacey sound\" with volume turned up.So I gave my 14 year old theHoward Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffand my 11 year old will probably get these (my older model pair).3M / Peltor - what have you done with a gold standard?

The tape used however is of fairly high quality and gives a very clear and flat reflection with no distortion. If the tape ever becomes damaged from use it shouldn't be too difficult to replace.

One of the \"1 star reviewers\" proposed a test supposedly proving that the circle on circle eclipse system doesn't work. I tried it and have no idea what his point is, as everything checked out fine for me. Other \"1-star\" reviewers complained of stuff that is easily resolved if you take a little time getting familiar with the 8099.  There were also complaints about some petty things; things that should NOT justify a 1-star rating - more later.This compass is intelligently designed and innovative. It is also full featured. The hard plastic casing and rubber boot offer superb protection for the the compass dial and transparent base-plate, which has all of the most commonly needed map scales. The Eclipse 8099 has a 1-degree graduated dial, marked for both forward and reverse sighting.  It has a magnifying lens over the graduations that allows for easy reading. A separate magnifying lens (larger than on many other base-plate map compasses) allows you to check out map details more easily. The rubber boot serves also as an eraser for pencil lines on your map. There is a magnetic declination adjustment, of course, and a clinometer for measuring heights and slopes. Contained within the boot are a set of quick reference cards that thoroughly explain how to use all of the map, compass and clinometer techniques. There is a tangent conversion table (Card 8). There are map and roamer scales (Card #6) Cards 9-11 even provide some basic survival and first aid reminders. I don't know of any other compass that gives you all of that in a self contained package.Prospective buyers might be interested to know that my son was a high speed US Special Forces guy, by necessity an expert in land-navigation. He is very familiar with use of the classic USMC Cammenga Lensatic compass and he says he'd much rather use my 8099.Now for some of the complaints that supposedly get this item a 1-star rating:\"The circle over circle alignment system doesn't really work\" - This is bogus nonsense or - if you prefer - BS. As I said above, I tested the fellow's theory and the compass checked out fine. If it didn't work out for him, he apparently was not using the mirror sighting lens correctly.\"It's hard to open the case completely\" - The protective rubber shoe should be thumbed off first, which is easy enough. If the opening the case completely is still too hard for you at that point, you are probably too delicate to risk being outdoors anyway and might do better to just stay home.\"It got a bubble\" - Maybe there are compasses out there that will never get a bubble but having used several brands and models, I don't know of any. I confess - my 8099 compass developed a bubble when I took it out on an early winter camping trip a few years ago. Cold temperatures do that to compasses because the damping fluid within the capsule contracts.  Set them out in the sunshine on a hot summer day and the bubble goes away (or at least shrinks to near nothing). Anyway, since this compass doesn't use a traditional needle, bubbles present no functional problem.One more remark has to do with value. When originally introduced - at a retail price of about $80.00 - the Eclipse 8099 was pretty pricey. But at the current pricing - about $30.00 less - the Eclipse 8099 offers what I consider to be very good value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top notch, full featured compass", "unixReviewTime": 1258416000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2009"}

The awl sees more use as a package slitter than awl in my use.If you decide to EDC a small SAK like this I recommend a lanyard that hangs out of your pocket;  it will make extraction easier and once out of the pocket it will be in a predictable position so you don't have to hunt for the correct blade.BTW, if the functionality and value of this knife appeal to you but you need a fixed blade, check out the Mora knives from Sweden.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Might be the perfect SAK", "unixReviewTime": 1337126400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2012"}

This 3 1/2 inch all-purpose tool is suitable for your pocket, glove compartment or tool box.  This knife has dozens of uses for a do-it-yourselfer, a gardener or a camper.This little wonder has a large and small knife, a corkscrew, a punch, a can opener with a flat blade screwdrive on the end, a bottle opener with a flat blade screwdriver on the end and what purports to be a wire stripper on the side (I have never used that), a key ring, tweezers and a toothpick.  This knife is water resistant and made of high quality components.I tend to use the knives on the pocket knife more than any other tools.  After that I find that the combination of one of the knives and the tweezers are useful for splinters and thorns, and thus the tweezers often become the third most useful tool. I must admit that occasionally I use the toothpick, particularly when real toothpicks are not available.The smaller screwdriver blade is small enough that it can also fit into a Phillips head screw. I have even been able to use the flat blade on some small internal hex head screws.  I have never used the corkscrew, and I have used the punch as an awl.  The can opener blade has yet to be used on this knife as well.The difficulty with carrying tools is that they can fill your pocket very quickly. This small Swiss Army knife is small enough to fit into a purse or a pocket and yet large enough to be useful.

It sat for a few months unused and I didn't pay it much attention cause the handle is so large it effectively makes the surface shorter since your holding the knife at an angle that's lower than the handle is tall so you can't make full passes.Well just messing around the other day I removed the excess plastic so I had a flat 2-sides sharpener and made a wood base I could set it into giving me the correct height to use it as a bench stone and allowing me to use the full length since there's no handle to get in the way.Since I did that I've used this little sharpener to quickly tune up several blades I was having trouble with on my larger Arkansas stones, particularly a few recurve shape blades, this cheap little diamond sharpener put a shaving sharp (but still pretty coarse, [they're \"fine\" is only around 800 grit]) edge on S30V steel on my ZT 0350 and the 154CM steel on my Benchmade 555 in no time. I also touched up my wife's spyderco with VG-10 which it cut like butter, I could reprofile that blade with ONLY the fine side, that's how well it cuts.Don't expect to see yourself in your nicely polished edge, but its got no problem taking a dull knife to shaving arm hair cleanly in under 10 minutes. The ergonomics of the sharpener take away from its sharpening ability, a half hour in the workshop building a nice little base is time well spent for the amount of time this diamond sharpener will save over going up threw the grits on Arkansas stones, not to mention the large difference in initial cost and the continued cost of honing oil /WD40 when using Oil stones.Since being impressed with this just a few days ago I already placed an order for aDMT D6EF 6-Inch Dia-Sharp Double-Sided Extra-Fine/Fine Bench Stonecontinous diamond stone (2-sides:fine/extra fine) but not because the DCS-4 doesn't make a satisfactory working edge, I just happen to like a smoother lookin edge so I'm going up to a 1200 grit diamond stone with the D6EF as well as it being 6x2 vs the smaller DSC4 @ only 4x1. I highly recommend DMT stones, 2 weeks ago I was happy with my sharpening setup and not even thinking about replacing or changing anything, this $14 4\" smiths DCS4 had made me COMPLETLY switch up my old tried-and-true sharpening technique. I would only give it 3* the ergonomics are so bad, but after giving it a chance and making the actual sharpening part of the sharpener into a usable device this one little thing impressed me so much I doubt I'll use an Arkansas stone again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This cheap little sharpener opened me up to a whole new technology, I had a full set of oil stones, now I have 2 diamond stones", "unixReviewTime": 1379289600, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2013"}

However, the coarse side did the best with about 20 strokes per side.  I like my knives to shave arm hair (easily); I cannot achieve ARM shave sharp easily with this sharpener (not with an AUS 8 blade).  My RAT 1 will shave a little bit, but the edge feels a bit burred.  The fine side is a little bit too fine (if you ask me).  Or, perhaps, the coarse, is just a little bit too coarse.

Don't use this thing on your nice folders; I recommend a Lansky Crock sticks 4 turn, or Spyderco sharpmaker for nice knives.Those sharpeners will sharpen at the perfect angles, and it's hard to scratch up your blades when the angle is already set for you.On the good, this sharpener leaves a very usable edge with use of the coarse side; for most of your utility and hunting knife purposes.

Ross \"Bacchuskitty\"", "helpful": [45, 45], "reviewText": "I think this is a useful and practical sharpener, but tends to be a jack of all trades:  It offers flexibility but doesn't do one thing exceedingly well.  Here are some observations based on my experience:Pros:Combination of Coarseness:  I like that this tool comes with both a coarse and fine stone.  I have various knives and blades in various conditions:  Sometimes a fine stone is just not enough to bring back a neglected edge to where it should be and I find the coarse stone is just what I need.  While I think the descriptions are reasonably accurate, this stone does take a learning curve to master.  Initially, both sides act coarser than they should be, as the diamonds break and wear to a more consistent surface.  It will seem, then, that it quickly loses its effectiveness, when in reality it is just breaking in.Utility:  On both sides of the stones, there is a flat patch for very small blades, which is nice.  There is also a groove on both stones for sharpening points of, say, fish hooks or needles.  I'm not sure how often I'll be sharpening my fish hooks, but it's a thoughtful feature.  The cover turns around to form a handle and, though made of plastic, it has held up well and doesn't allow the stone to shift when sharpening.  Unlike a more traditional stone meant to sit flat on a surface, this one is best held at an angle, keeping the tip held on a surface with the handle.  This is how I've been using it and find that works best for me.  The relatively small size of this sharpener requires a different technique than having a large stone to work on, using both hands on the blade, when the stone sits on a flat surface.  Overall, this stone is able to sharpen a broad range of edges, whether on knives, wood carving tools, etc.Effectiveness:  I have found this stone to be effective sharpening a range of tools, from my high carbon kitchen knives, to my EDC folder, to my stainless multitool blades.  It works, and I've been happy with it.Cons:Size:  I'm not sure this is a con, but I find this tool somewhat awkward to use.  Ideally, I prefer sharpening my tools, whatever they are, in the comfort of my shop, using both hands, on a large stone.  With this, you just can't do that.  Ah, you say, it's not meant for that!  True... but I find myself, more often than not, sharpening my knives back at home after backpacking or camping, rather than on site where I can't do as good a job at it.  I like its versatility and I do think it works really well.  It's just that... this usually isn't the one I reach for.  Would I use this one when I'm at home versus the larger stones on my bench?  No.  Would I take this one backpacking?  No, because I'd be going into the back country with sharp blades to begin with and I'm certainly not going to carry something this heavy unless it's essential.  Would I keep it in my truck?  Mmmmm.... maybe, but 9 out of 10 times I'd be bringing my blades back home to sharpen anyway.  Would I want this if I had to bug out due to zombie attack?  Well, of course I would!!!  But that hasn't happened yet and I'm starting to wonder if it will...Other Thoughts:This is a good quality, multi-purpose, compact sharpener at a pretty decent value.  There are plenty of purists out there who would howl at the thought of allowing their blades to touch anything but crazy-expensive exotic water stones.  Whatever.  Unless you've just dropped your (or your kid's) college tuition on a blade that will never, ever be used for fear of getting a nick on the edge, this sharpener will work just fine and will give you a decent-to-near-scalpel edge if you use it properly.  (with or without stropping for you edge geeks)The question is, is this the right tool for you?  Personally, I find myself reaching for the stones that are dedicated to my bench top most often, and so this one ends up living in my camping gear.  If you are short on space, though, or find yourself with a more portable lifestyle, this sharpener may be for you.

Within a few weeks the reticle control knob became stiff, and later wouldn't turn to the small dot position.  I have tried several times to force it, but am deathly afraid I'm going to break it! The other three still work, though, maintaining my faith in Bushnell.  Enter this simple 1-dot Bushnell sight that I purchased for another 10/22.  It's a bit smaller, less bulky, lighter, has fewer knobs and in short, is more simple to operate.  The dot, intensity, and vertical/horizontal adjustments work great.......sometimes the k.i.s.s. rule is a good thing!  If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have purchased two of these and left the 4-reticle job for someone else.  P.S.  I did not use the included vertical split rings (a style I've never liked), opting instead for a set of Weaver-style quick detach rings which tighten better with no possibility of stripping.UPDATE:  I have since purchased a second of these Bushnell red dot sights, and love them both.  During recent range trips, all three of my Bushnell sights (the 4-reticle included, as it now has it's fourth position back) worked flawlessly.  Which of my sights are giving me fits?

There are no big tactical turrets, no big AO side wheel, and no illumination control. However, the optics is superb for the price point, the scope is lightweight for its class, the size is compact, and it just plain works well!Mine is on a Feinwerkbau 300S target airgun. Although the airgun is not powerful by today's standard, it still has considerable spring-piston type recoil on the action, and that transmits to the scope. After sighting in and practicing for an hour, this is holding up well. There are others who use this scope on the same airgun, I have confidence that it will last and maintain zero.Note that the reticle (Bushnell Multi-X) of this scope is the same as the one on the Bushnell 6-18x50 scopes, the thin line section spans 5.4 inches at 55 yards (far end of field target competitions) at 12x. It is not a 30/30 reticle, about half the size. Due to the smaller thin line section, this reticle is actually quite useful for windage and elevation compensation if you are good at guestimating the POI (point-of-impact) based on scaling features of a reticle. I recommend the Android app Strelok+ as a ballistic calculator because it has a good library of scope reticles, including that of this scope! Strelok+ can show the POI from a scope's view based on magnification.This scope isn't for everyone. People who prefer target turrets will not like the small finger-turnable elevation/windage dials and the difficult-to-read marking. People who prefer mil-dots to guestimate POI will not like the rather simplistic Multi-X reticle. However, \"intuitive\" shooters who set-and-forget elevation/windage and rely on reticle scaling may enjoy the simplicity of this scope.To summarize, I like this scope for the following reasons. It is compact without all the tall turrets, making it fit into the case a bit easier. It is lightweight and does not make a rifle top heavy. The optics is very good for the price. The center part of the reticle has very fine lines without busy dots. The price is just right for the quality.EDIT 4/14: After my first field target match, I am very pleased with this scope. It held zero just fine on a medium-low power spring-piston FWB 300S. The duplex reticle (Multi-X) worked well even though some shooters may prefer a mil-dot for hold over/under guestimates.

I have had excellent luck with their products, and this scope is a great example of why I will continue to use Bushnell optics.  For the money, the Banner line offers good glass and coatings.  I like them as much as many of my more expensive scopes.  This model impresses me even more than the 6-24x40 Banner that I have on my Savage mk2 btv.  The 6-24 is great, but at the higher powers in low light, the image becomes somewhat dim and eye position is very crucial.  That doesn't matter much on a bright day at the range, so it is fine for that rifle, but this 6-18x50 model is so much brighter at all magnification levels, and is much less picky about eye positioning at 18x.  The image quality is very good, the coatings are good at controlling flare, and the magnification and parallax rings both turn smoothly enough.  Everything about this scope seems too good to be true at this price.  Basically, if you want a scope for long range precision shooting and the lighting may not always be the best, this may be your best choice if you are on a limited budget.The only things I don't like, or think that a potential buyer should consider are:This scope is not very heavy for its size, but it is large, and may be too big to look appropriate on some rifles.The scope will require very high rings on most rifles so that the objective bell may clear the barrel.  If your stock does not have a raised cheekpiece, you will have trouble getting a good cheek weld.  If you have a straight-backed stock without a raised cheekpiece, you will want to either modify/replace your stock, or go with a scope with a 40mm objective.  For a compact rifle with no cheekpad, I can't recommend anything more highly than the Super Banner 3.5-10x36mm scope.  It is one of the most enjoyable and useful scopes I own, because it works equally well on a squirrel rifle, a target gun, or a deer rifle, and doesn't add too much bulk or weight for the quality it delivers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a LOT of scope for a little cash", "unixReviewTime": 1323907200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011"}

Recently I pulled out my Marlin Model 883 .22 WMR rifle and found that with my bifocal eyeglasses I can see the front sight and target fine, but the rear sight is too much of a blur to use.  I was afraid that this beautiful rifle would be useless to me, but then I remembered this scope.  Common sense told me that since any scope is focusable I should be able to adjust this scope to my eyeglasses/eyesight. Since I need glasses to even see the target before sighting in on it, I adjusted the focus for a clear view when wearing glasses.  WONDERFUL!  I can now shoot as well as when I was in my teens, although I just turned 62!The scope itself is very well made; I think the quality is excellent considering the price.The view is bright and reasonably clear, with no internal debris on the lenses (I say 'reasonably clear' because it is certainly good enough for hunting/target shooting, but not quite as sharp as a higher priced scope or a good binocular).The adjustment caps and focusing ring are rubber sealed.  Mine came with see-through lens caps, one is clear and the other has a yellow tint for cloudy conditions. I have not read reviews or descriptions mentioning the clear caps, so maybe they are no longer included.  Also, mine does not have the cheap looking gold trim of this later model.The 30/30 reticle serves as a distance estimater.  The 'thin' center section of the crosshairs span 30 inches at 100 yards with the scope set at 4X, but of course the scope itself shows a much wider view.  So, setting it to 8X produces  15 inch span of the thin section of the crosshairs at 100 yards, or at 50 yards with it set at 4X the span is 15 inches, etcetera, etcetera.  But first you must know the approximate size of the grizzly, buck, doe, jackrabbit, prairie dog, etc, in inches; then you can figure out how far away it is with this scope so you know how much to hold the crosshairs over the target for bullet drop.  The best thing though is to learn to estimate distances by eye, rather than wasting time and possibly missing a shot trying to do the math in your head.Changing the magnification does not affect focus or parallax as it does on some other inexpensive scopes.I do remember that when I first got the scope and was looking through it that parallax needed to be adjusted slightly for 100 yards so the target would not seem to move in relation to the crosshairs when I moved my head a little from side to side. This required the front lens element to be screwed in or out, which then required refocus. Other reviewers make no mention of this, so it may have been just MY scope.  I made the adjustments with the scope off the rifle, attached to a camera tripod with bungee cord, and got the adjustments as close to perfect as humanly possible I think, by focusing in on some small tree branch tips about 100 yards away.  I like to set parallax and focus for 100 yards, even on my .22 rifles.  That way parallax and focus will be spot on for distances from several yards out to infinity.  Focus is accomplished by turning the rear ring, and magnification is changed by turning a ring marked 3X through 9X just forward of the focusing ring. Be aware that the front bezel and rear focusing ring/lock ring both have thin o-rings that sort of fit down into the threads, so they must be moved by fingernail or a small tool so as not to be damaged by the bezel or focusing ring/lock ring being screwed over them.Concerning the claim that this scope is fogproof:  I don't see how at this price; this would require the scope to be nitrogen filled, and I see no claims of this in the description.  I think you would have to spend more for this feature, BUT I WILL RESERVE FINAL JUDGEMENT ON THIS UNTIL I TAKE THE SCOPE OUT INTO TRULY COLD WEATHER.  Back in my early teens I would hunt for several hours in snow up to my knees and temperatures below freezing (Wisconsin) and my non-nitrogen filled scopes always fogged up at some point.  I finally resorted to removing the scopes and using iron sights. I didn't get any squirrels in those weather conditions, they were smarter than me, they stayed inside!Based on my recent experiences, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this reasonably high quality, low cost scope! By the way, I see this scope is also sold on Amazon as 'Mauser', 'Mosin Nagant' and other brands and includes the clear lens covers I mentioned as well as rings, a mounting rail, and lens cleaner. One of those packages might be a better value if you have a rifle that will accept that package.NOTE!  I have a couple other rifles and I can use their iron sights fine with my eyeglasses. The difference is that they have lower combs that allow me to bring my eye lower to line up the sights so that I use the upper part of my bifocals to see both iron sights and a distant target with no problem.ADDED 12/3/11:  It is below freezing tonight, so I decided to see how 'fogproof' this scope is.  I put it outside for 2 hours, then checked it.  NO FOG.  I then brought it in to the warm house and it IMMEDIATELY FOGGED UP on the outside and inside of the lenses.  But less than 10 minutes later there was NO TRACE OF FOG.  It seems to me that if it does not fog up OUTSIDE in the cold, where I will be using it, it is at least fog resistant, if not fog proof.  But make your own conclusion.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I can shoot again with my eyeglasses!", "unixReviewTime": 1321488000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2011"}

Meanwhile, the 4 and 5 stars look at this scope as I do, a good way to measure distance.Oh, and for those saying \"it only works for 50-to-200 yards/meters\", well, that's not true...just 'double' or 'half' your image relative to the distance marks...or inversely, 'double-or-half' your distance.The technology involved on how this works is about 2000-years old. The marks in the lens is keyed to the idea that the golf pennant is 6-ft above the cup. So, if your pennant is 6-ft out of the cup, then you just base the bottom line on the bottom of the pole, at the cup, and the top line gives your distance reading.  Again, if you assume a deer is 3-ft tall at the shoulders, and an elk is 6-ft, then you can still use the monocular for hunting, too...even bow hunting! Just take that deer, put the bottom mark at the hooves, then at the shoulder blade you just take the reading...and then half it...since the deer is only HALF of 6-ft tall at the shoulders.  So, if that reading was 100yds, then he is really only 50-yds away. Simple.Nope, its not a laser unit...then again, I don't have to lose the trophy of a lifetime because my primo batteries just ran out, or my clumsy dropping of a 600-dollar unit into a stream in the high-country caused my super-special digital unit to stop working.It works, it works well, and its made well.

For the money, I have to say that this is a relatively good scope.  The two areas I have primarily used this scope is in bird watching, i.e. shore birds, vultures and eagles.  Secondly, I have used in on the pistol range as a spotter.  In both cases it performed adequately to superb.Now I am not a technical person.  For me, optical equipment either works or it does not work and I have no clue as to the technical in and outs of the instrument being used. I have little to no patience for equipment that does not function at the job I pay for...not matter what the technical reason.  From a practical standpoint though, there are some considerations.First:  If you use this scope at the higher magnifications, then you must have a better tripod that comes with it.  You need very solid support.  There was no problem in this area when on the shooting range as the scope was mounted on a very substantial bench and sighed in on a specific target.  The problem here, again at the higher magnifications, is the ability to quickly find your subject.  This at times was difficult to do as the picture is quite small and the slightest movement was quite troublesome.  the lower magnifications were great for scanning the shore line and river banks.Second:  This scope cannot be attached to a camera.  For the money I suppose you cannot expect everything, but the buyer should be aware of this.Third:  I love the fact that there was absolutely no problem with \"steaming up.\"  The scope is quite waterproof and if you are working a lake, stream or marsh you need not worry.  The scope is very rugged.Fourth:  I found the image quality, especially when you consider the price, to be amazingly good; quite clear and this enables to get a very detailed view of your subject.Fifth:  This optic does weigh around seven pounds which is lighter than some, but still and all if you are trekking a great distance, then seven pounds is seven pounds...if you know what I mean.Sixth:  The cases that come with the scope...well, I have seen better, but there again, look at the price you are paying.  The quality of the cases for me, are of little moment.Seventh:  In an ideal situation I always recommend using a scope in the field before purchasing.  I was lucky to be able to do this.  Each person has their own needs and what works great for one person, might not be the best for another.Bottom line is that unless you are ultra serious about your hobby and/or want to impress those who are impressed by such things, i.e. expensive stuff, then I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this unit.

At 300 yards I can clearly see the metal plates we shoot at at our rifle range.  I used it for sight seeing and about 4 miles away I could see the large lettering on the side of the delivery van.  At the same distance at night I could see the 1 foot lighted lettering on the side of the building.  Good enough for target shooting for most yardages from 50 to 300.  I don't shoot farther than 300 yards as our rifle range only goes that far. But Very Good for these ranges.  Buy another tripod, more heavy duty.  If you have the scope on the same bench as the bench you shoot on, it will move when you shoot.  Get a good sturdy tripod.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value and clear viewing", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}

I've completed the P90X program three times... unfortunately, I've had to order several of the bands multiple times... once each time I've done the 90 day program.So... be warned... if you're going to be REALLY working out with these bands for an extended period, you'll probably wear them out in a few months.  At first you'll notice little white areas where the rubber has begun to fail.  Once a hole develops, use care, because it doesn't take long from that point for the band to be in a position to snap during exercise.  I didn't heed my own better sense of judgement the first time I went through the program, and had a blue band snap on me mid rep.  This was my own fault as I KNEW I should have discontinued use.Why the four stars if I've had to replace them?  Because the bands work!  ... and they're a great value.  Free weights typically cost about a buck a pound.  So if you're capable of lifting large amounts, a suitable set of weights can set you back a fortune.

They make a sturdy, long-lasting resistance band. I've used bands for some twenty years and love them. They're as good as weights. After all, your muscles don't know if you're lifting iron weights or pulling rubber resistance. They only know they're working.I'd been thinking seriously about getting the Bodylastics line this go round. After about 15 years my red band showed some signs of wear. I tend to default to the red one so it gets lots of use. I've never had a Spri band snap on me. I've never had a bit of trouble with one. They tend to last a very long time but you really should consider changing them from time to time even if they show no wear as any rubber band will lose some of it's strength after time. I should have changed mine sooner.As I looked at the Bodylastics I could see it would be hard to know if and when the band was wearing near the handle, one of the first places a band will give. That could cause problems down the road.So I simply bought a new Spri band. If you don't like the handle, you can buy theSPRI XT-MU Xertube with Padded Foam Handles - Medium Resistance. I have several and they're nice. But I chose the one that's not padded to use with a bar for some extra workout moves. You can't use the bar with padded handles. You can check out the bar atSPRI Xercise Bar.The SPRI bands are dependable and last a long time.

For example, I sometimes carry a phone when I am expecting an early morning call I need to take. For years, I had been using an old, small fanny-pack, but time had taken its toll. So I needed a replacement. I decided to try this pack, since it is supposed to be designed for running.After trying it, I found I liked it much more than the old pack.

Since I don't smoke, I often forget to see if my lighter has fluid in it.  Several times I've arrived at my site, and found my lighter wouldn't light.  I've had fair luck with other flint and steel fire starters, but this is the best of the ones I've tried.  A major advantage in my opinion, is that it can be operated with one hand, which could be useful if you were injured.  Another advantage is that you don't need to use a knife, which always carries some risk of personal injury.  This device also puts out more spark than I get with the other magnesium sparkers I've tried.It does seem a little bit like a gadget, and is more likely to break than a bar of magnesium with a flint on one side.  One the other hand, even if it broke (and mine still works great after lighting a dozen or so fires), you would at worst have an overpriced \"normal\" sparker.  If you're worried about price, I think a $3 magnesium and flint bar is a better value.  I keep a blast match in my emergency backpack (bug out bag), and in my Camelback hydration day pack.  In my glove box, my camping jacket, and a few other places, I have a cheap flint (and sometimes even a working lighter).  My friends that have seen me use the Blast Match are generally impressed, but none of them liked it enough to buy one.

I carry about an ounce cut off a waxy instant fire log, to use as tinder.  A chunk of waxy wood the size of 4 stacked pennies, will burn for long enough, that you should be able to build a real fire around (above) it.  The blast match seems to light just about anything you could light with a match (assuming you can stab at the thing and not worry about knocking it over.)

With this feature, you can use your hand to block out wind when starting a fire, if need be.  Simply use your thumb to push down on the striker and abruptly push the spring loaded steel to generate extremely hot sparks.  Do to the size of the rod, this thing SHOWERS sparks.  The rod also rotates 360 degrees so it will wear down evenly and you wont have one side of the rod depleated over time.the plastic seems like it will hold up adequately over time.  These were actually developed for Air Force fighter pilots so I imagine they went through some rigourous testing.  The casing can also swivel over the top of the firesteel so it packs at a compact 4 inches.Great little piece of gear for any camper or someone putting together an emergency kit.  However, always you make sure you have backup ways for fire.  The blastmatch has mechanical parts which makes it prone to possible failures with use over time.

It is made well enough for its purpose and it isn't too large to carry along, although sturdier and smaller would be good. I got into trouble attempting to cross a stream while dragging a deer this December here in the Kodiak islands. I got dunked in ice water with temps around 15 degrees, a 25kt wind was blowing and I had almost 2 miles of steep little hills covered with knee deep snow ahead of me. It wasn't as much fun as it sounds. Anyway, I was able to make a fire in spite of the fact that I could not bend my fingers to operate a lighter. Regular Bic lighters were my \"go to\" till I got one of these. You can use the blast match with one cold hand where you honestly couldn't flick a lighter to save your life. Sure, a guy might think of some way to make it \"better\"; reduce size or make it lighter, make it laser guided and have it delivered by miss America or something like that, but, I can't deny results. Five stars.UPDATE!Well... more of a qualifying statement really.I've continued to use the blast match (same one) for the better part of a year now and I guess I've started 70 or 80 fires with it since that first use above. The thing is still going. *My qualifier: Don't go running into the woods expecting to point the blast match at a wet log in the rain and have the thing burst into flames; the planet cannon from the deathstar it is not. You still need DRY, fine, tinder or, better yet, do what I do which borders on cheating - I use little blocks of WetFire AND magnesium fire starter as well when I've got both to use and things are wet. I pile my tinder and wood shavings around the end of a sturdy chunk of wood that serves as my base plate. Generally my base piece is just a short stick that I've batoned in half, length wise, with my Ka-bar. I put the WetFire block on my flat base piece, shave a layer of magnesium on top of that and then strike the blast match next to it to set the thing off. That'll frikken do it I tell you, wet wood or no. Pull a bullet and substitute gunpowder if you can keep it dry and that will work well too. As long as you can supply enough in the way of twigs and/or wood shavings your little piece of WetFire should burn long enough to keep your fire going initially and you can add bigger pieces and generate enough heat to dry wet stuff as you go. It's so much easier than just dry tinder it's almost embarrasing. \"well why not just use a lighter then?\" you ask. A lighter will work with Wetfire of course, just so long as the lighter stays dry and/or does not/has not run out of fuel or it isn't so cold the lighter doesn't want to work.

Recently, though, I got yet another low-back sprain (for no reason at all!) and sciatic pain at the same time, and thought I should probably try something besides \"benign neglect.\" I ordered the GIB2 boots and they arrived today. I'm sold already.Getting the boots to the bar was easy; my major concern was being able to get my hands back up to the bar to dismount (particularly after a very silly jerry-rigged inversion scheme that nearly backfired, no pun intended). I sort of \"climbed up\" my own legs and it wasn't a problem. As other commenters have mentioned, the boots tend to be uncomfortable around the ankles, but since my hanging intervals will probably be relatively short, I can deal with it.I have a neck traction device that I like to use, so I'm no stranger to the \"lightening\" feeling of spinal decompression. On my first full \"hang,\" the decompression effect was immediately noticeable. About 30 minutes later I was feeling some minor new aches across my back, but I'm neither surprised nor worried. New movements often result in new minor aches and pains. (If they get worse, I'll start worrying.)The boots themselves are built like a tank. I particularly like the little \"safety lever\" on the latch that prevents them from opening at the wrong time.

First I must address the SQUEAKING issue.  I read online when you first assemble the unit, put Car grease inside the tubes that the AXLE rod goes through, trust me, do this now as you assemble and you won't have squeak problems, the Axle rod comes with a thin coating of oil and will quickly wear off, car grease is heavy duty and will do the job!Ok the machine, its like walking on air!  Much better than walking in place or using a personal trampaline.#2. Many have said this machine gives you NO or Zero resistance and after you got better in shape that you quickly out grow the Edge.Here's a VERY Easy way to fix that.A. Wlamrt and other stores sell Weights that go on to bar bells and dumb bells. The Gold's Gym brand of weights have a larger hole in the center. BUY those! Start off with two 5 lbs weights and slide them through the hand grip poles and let them rest on the machine bar (same bar that has the digital counter).This will give you resistance, you can add more weights, I don't say getting more and put on top of each other, but go buy the 10 lb's weights.B. Another option is to take those Adjustable Wrist bands (2 and 5 lbs...leg bands as high as 10 lbs) and wrap those around the bottom legs of the machine in the front. They will give you outstanding resistance as well.Problem Solved !C. This one is my personal favorite way to ADD RESISTANCE. Add 5 or 10 lb dumb-bells to the legs. You can clamp them on with simple automotive clamps, the dumb-bells will fit on super tight, no movement, no noise at all! You will deff feel the added weight in the legs of the Gazelle!You have a wide range of motion, you can put more force on your upper arms, grabbing up and down for a upper body workout, you can go fast, go slow, watch tv at a slow pace and get lost in a movie while getting your body moving!I am that does almost Nothing for exercise, I walk my Dog but big whoop, I slow walk.I get very bored with exercising, I wanted something that seems fun, easy to do and gets my whole body working, this does that!

Since I am woefully out of shape and somewhat overweight (5'8&#34;, 195 pounds, size 14, 53 years old), I thought it'd be exercise for me, if only non-intense.  A knee injury plus plantar fasciitis makes any kind of moderate to high impact impossible and painful for me.Well, it was DEFINITELY &#34;no impact,&#34; and that was a major plus.  Gentle swinging was better for me than the elliptical at the gym, too.  But I watched an entire episode of Dexter while using this thing (moderately, not slowly) and didn't break a sweat.  I checked - my heart rate was up (I didn't bother attaching the computer after reading reviews), but not extensively (and who knows, maybe it was up because I had just spent an hour watching Dex hack people up).  What I HAVE noticed, today, though, is that my arms (biceps, triceps) are sore.  While using the GE last night, I kept changing things up, just because just &#34;skiing&#34; would get a little tedious.  I'd lean forward, which then required pushing me back, and I'd lean backwards, which required me pulling myself back, and sometimes I'd keep both feet parallel and just push myself back and forth with my arms.  This is a good thing, since I'm a pathetic weakling, and I'm getting a good upper arm workout.  Arguable, I'm not doing the very wide scissoring I saw in some of the workout videos, and I wasn't going at a super-fast clip, so I expect I need to put more into the workout to get more out of it, from an aerobic point of view.  Based on some consumer recommendations (thanks, guys!) I ordered some ankle and wrist weights.  After an hour, my feet were uncomfortable (might be shoes, but I wear good ones), but that might because I was functionally standing still on a hard surface for an hour... half-hour stints would be completely manageable.It was not particularly difficult to assemble by myself (took 1 hour 15 minutes), although there were a couple of awkward wrangling moments where a second person would have been helpful.  I couldn't quite get the top bar ends completely pushed to the middle central piece, but almost.  Those screws were also very difficult to seat (ie, find the threads) and a substantial amount of unladylike invective was required.  When I was done, I had a bit of a &#34;restaurant table wobble&#34; to it, but I shimmed it and it was OK.  Periodically it squeaked or clicked or made some other rhythmic noise... not loud, but annoying enough when watching TV.  It was also surprisingly heavy (to me) when I picked it up to move it to another room.  So...PROS:Zero impactVery good for armsEasy enough to use and watch TV or a movie at the same timeBetter than sitting on your butt (seriously, I use it more than other exercise equipment)Not that hard to buildCONS:Not really &#34;exercise&#34; (or at least aerobic), even for a deconditioned, overweight personA little wobbly and unstable at &#34;high speeds&#34; (might be a consequence of my construction skills)Somewhat noisy at times (not loud, just annoying)HeavyIf I had tried it in a store first, I think I still would have bought it, and assumed that using it for a longer period of time was a &#34;workout.&#34;  I don't regret the purchase, I anticipate using it regularly.

Davis \"The Happy Hermit\"", "helpful": [87, 94], "reviewText": "The only reason I do not give five stars is because it is not silent but it is pretty quiet and for under $100 it's one of the decade's best bargains.  First let me say that I am a 53 year old female and in fairly good shape.  My main exercise is walking - I walk five miles at least four times a week (also use my bike to run errands and shop).  I wanted something to do on my no-walk days that would work different muscles.  The Gazelle is fun and not difficult or unpleasant so of course I'm thinking \"this can't be doing any good\".  No Pain No Gain right?  But walking doesn't hurt and is enjoyable too and it does plenty of good so why can't the Gazelle be fun and still effective?  I do 30 - 40 minutes on the Gazelle about three times a week, sometimes to a TV program and sometimes to music.  When working out to music the Gazelle is exceptionally accomodating in that you can adjust your pace and stride to match ANY tempo.  You can really go at it on this thing or you can take it easy.  I like being able to alter the intensity.  The fact that it is pleasant and enjoyable is more important than you might think - the more fun it is the more apt you are to use it and I don't care how expensive or \"efficient\" a piece of equipment is if you don't enjoy using it eventually YOU WON'T and how much good will it do then?  The Gazelle will be your buddy, not the enemy sitting there waiting to punish you.  I have rigged mine up with padded cotton on the foot platforms and cotton socks pulled over the handles so that I can just get on barefoot with no preparation whatsoever and go.  All I'm in contact with is cotton which feels really good when you heat up.  Hands up high on the handles and you are getting a good upper body workout, hands in the middle section and you are sharing the load between upper and lower body, hands low down and your legs are doing most of the work.  As fun and  easy as it is when I get off my legs are wobbly so I know for certain that I have been exerting myself.  You can work out in many ways like others have said in their reviews - twisting, leaning forward or back, bending you knees, up on your toes, etc.  I didn't get a video but lively music will spur you to move in new and creative ways if you get into it.  It's like dancing!  I did not bother with the electronic read-out thing - it looks pretty useless to me.  The clicks and squeaks (and yes I made sure all connections were tight) are not that bad, you can still easily watch TV or listen to music.  I have my TV watching/CD playing device right smack in front of my face when I am on the Gazelle, as close as it can be considering the forward swing of the pedals.  The whole thing is a simple system of frame and swinging foot platforms suspended by cables - NO PISTONS TO HEAT UP AND LEAK.  If there are animals in your house that don't have enough sense to stay away from the Gazelle when you are using it (you know the type) you will want to put your Gazelle in a room or area that can be closed off.  Frame tubing is fat and comes in a nice looking silvery gray finish.  It's not what would be considered compact so you will need plenty of floor space - at least 34\" wide and 74\" long to allow for full swing.  One reviewer mentioned clips that would hold the foot platforms against the tubing when folding the Gazelle but I have yet to find those on mine, maybe I have a different model.  Personally I am really glad that I do not have to fold and store mine, it's heavy and big and I'm certain I'd never use it if I had to go through that much trouble.  I highly recommend the Gazelle for people who have the space to keep it up and the time to use it for at least 30  minutes several times a week.

I have a Marcy recumbent Bike that I use when I want to watch TV and not be a Couch potato.  It is great for that, but I needed something that would give me a more robust workout. I decided to try this because of its price and positive reviews. These are my thoughts on this:Pros:1. Ease of assembly-It took me about 25 minutes to put this together, and most of that time was spent reading the assembly guide. There is not much too it. 4 bolts on the base, 2 on the axle, 4 for the handles and one for the Computer. That is it.2. Quality - It is durable, and solid.  It is not at all flimsy in anyway.  I feel that they have made improvements to this model since it first came out 5 or 6 years ago.3. Workout - This is the most important.  It give a good aerobic and anaerobic work out. You just need to mix it up. Vary your routines. I could feel the burn after a 30 minute workout.4. Space - It takes seconds to fold this flat, and against the wall. Like it was not even there.5. Price - Don't buy an expensive Elliptical until you have tried this. This is so inexpensive. Cheaper than a dinner for 2.6. Quiet - It makes absolutely no noise. I did not have to do any oiling either.Cons:1. Exercise video - I wish they would have included an exercise video with this.

Why? Because it makes noise. I have tried various modifications, lubrication, duct tape, etc, to make the darn thing shut up, but within half an hour of using it, the squeaking and vibrating always comes back. It's not all that loud but it annoys the bejeezus out of me.Even times when I don't care so much about the noise, it's not fun to keep at it for hours. The leg-swing motions may not take more energy than walking, but they're less comfortable.The &#34;computer&#34; on the crossbar is fairly useless.The best strategy is to make the hand and leg motions work against each other to create some resistance, but you can't go very fast without starting to get wobbly.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a very good workout", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}

This is NOT an elliptical, nor does it claim to be. It's a very simple machine.Second, if you're expecting to get on a machine, hit a button, and be forced to challenge yourself (because the treadmill is going fast or the elliptical resistance is on high), think carefully before buying the Edge. You ARE the resistance here--it's very possible to take a leisurely stroll the entire time and not break a sweat. That's why many reviewers complain that they didn't even get a cardio workout. They're right--this is not a machine that will demand you sweat because if you don't, you will fall off the treadmill or not be able to push the pedals. If you don't push yourself--lean back, lean forward to put weight on your arms, go at a fast pace even though nothing in the machine is making you--then it's true, you won't even break a sweat on this thing if you go at it for 40+ minutes.What this machine is good for is the person who wants to be able to exercise in their home. Maybe you can't afford a decent elliptical and don't want to bother with a cheap one that has bad reviews. If you're just looking to get your heart rate a little elevated and just get some motion into your life while you watch TV, then this is ideal. If you're a fitness fanatic and want to burn mega calories, this is NOT for you--unless you're willing to go super fast and do hardcore leaning to get some resistance. Even then, though, it is not comfortable for long workouts--your feet slide on the pedals, so your toes get squished against the front bumper.So basically, know what you want and then decide. I'm in my 20s and am relatively active, and this was a good stand-in until I could afford a &#34;real&#34; elliptical. It enabled me to at least be moving while I watched TV, and I did break a sweat and get a good workout in when I pushed myself. The problem is that you can't mindlessly get a good workout on this thing--you have to very consciously MAKE your body work. But it's a great price, super easy together, and folds easily out of sight.If you're new to exercise or simply don't have the space or money for a true elliptical, this could be a good starter machine for you. See if you use it and if you do, maybe you can graduate to an actual elliptical down the road. Just don't buy this expecting a full-blast cardio workout while you check out and watch TV...you will have to bring some intention to get a good workout on this thing.CONS:- squeaks (tried WD-40, didn't help)- the right side of mine seemed tighter, like it didn't get the same range of motion as the left foot.- the little plastic things where the pedal meets the cable can knock against other plastic, making a little knocking noise- your feet slide on the pedals, so your toes eventually get rammed against the front of the pedal...or slip backward- no resistance, so you really must push yourself if you want to break a sweatPROS:- easy to install- folds flat, could easily stash it when people come over- small footprint--although leave room for the long stride length/range of motion!- cheap, easy way to get yourself moving instead of sitting on the couch", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Low-impact, cheap alternative to real elliptical", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}

It is a great little excercise machine but does have some short comings.I opted for this one because:1.  PRICE:  After trying out the ellipticals it became very clear that cheap ellipticals are incredibly uncomfortable to use.  The motion on machines under $750 was either jerky or the short stride lead to the machine feeling more like a stepper than an elliptical.  Many of the low line models were not all that stable.  Of the mid-range steppers, I almost bought the Horizons E70 on sale for about $550 (marked down from the mid-$700s).  This machine lacked a lot of options but did have the most natural motion I could find in a stepper in this range.  Nevertheless, the motion on the Gazelle (they had the souped up Freestyle with thumb-pulse) was at least as good.  The price on the Freestyle is about $200 on Amazon.com and the basic model is less than $1002. REVIEWS:  Canvassing the internet, the Gazelle had a high satisfaction rates on a number of websites, including Amazon reviews.  The low to mid-range ellipticals appeared to have poor reliability ratings and most reviews showed low satisfaction.3. BASIC MACHINE:  It appeared to be a basic no-frills machine.  If I was going to buy something at  a low price range with few options, this one was as good as any other and far cheaper.  It is also more light-weight and portable than any of the ellipticals I tried.After purchasing, I feel like I've hit the jackpot.  The machine was easy to assemble, given its simple mechanism and few working parts.  It offers a reasonable, comfortable workout and is remarkably stable.  It also folds down flat for storage and weighs only about 40 lbs.  It also requires little room to use.  The manual recommends 3 feet in front and behind the machine, but 2 ? seemed to suffice for me.  So far my machine is remarkably smooth and silent.  There have been reports of squeaking, but I have not experienced this.  The manual suggests lubing the machine with vasoline if this occurs...  Despite the fact that Tony Little makes annoying infomercials, I think he has a winner in this machine.Nevertheless, it is important to realize that the machine has certain limitations:1. This is NOT a $1,500 Nordic Track Elliptical.  It doesn't have the programs, options, and fluid movement of a high-line elliptical trainer.  If you want such a model, you will have to spend the money to buy one.  That being said, this machine will not approach the smoothness/comfort of the expensive ellipticals and is really not comparable.2. This is NOT an elliptical trainer.  The motion is different, pleasant though it may be.3. The machine has NO built-in training programs.  You have to either buy Tony Little's exercise tapes or make up a program as you go along.  I did not opt to buy these, so I can't comment on them.  There are purportedly 7 different exercises that you can do on the Gazelle, but in reality there are only three that I can discern:  You can `Gazelle in the neutral position, leaning back, or leaning forward.  The other `exercises' involve different grip heights, letting go/swinging your arms at your sides, bending your knees for a lower/longer stride, and `gazelling' on your toes.  The latter variations don't really count for me as different exercises, but that's only my opinion.4. The basic machine has NO resistance adjustment.  The `Freestyle' and `Pro' models appear to have hydraulic resistance that is adjustable to three levels.  Having tried the Freestyle in the store, the hydraulic pistons did add resistance but seemed to make the motion a little less natural for me.  Additionally, there was no way to adjust these while exercising.  One would have to stop.  Get off the machine.  Adjust the resistance and resume exercising.  Lower line ellipticals can be adjusted while exercising, the Gazelle cannot.  Despite the lack of resistance, you can still get a good beginner to intermediate workout on this machine.  It is certainly good for people just beginning a fitness program.  I alternate aerobic and exercise training for 30 to 40 minutes, 6 days a week and have been doing so for over two years.  I would consider myself to be an intermediate to advanced level and was able to raise my heart rate to the target range on this machine.5. It has an INADEQUATE fitness computer.  The fitness computer tell you your speed, how far you have `travelled', the number of calories burned, and the time on the machine.  Being a skeptic, I think the only reliable feature would be the time and possibly `distance'.  I'm not knocking the company.  Knowing how much time you have spent on the device is my most important issue.  I could imagine using the `distance' counter as a measure of when to stop the workout.  I just don't know exactly what `speed' means or howe exactly it calculates `distance' traveled or how the device calculates the number of calories when it doesn't know your weight or the exact amount of applied resistance.Having demoed the Freestyle, I don't think that the hydraulic pistons are worth the extra $100+ for the inexperienced Gazeller. (After a few months, I might change my mind about this but I don't think so.)  You can also buy a number of other models which appear to have more heavy-duty tubing and extra's like water bottle holders.  For my purposes, the basic machine appears to be just right.  I wasn't about to plunk down more money for a cupholder or an advanced computer.  The thumb pulse feature might be helpful to see if you achieve your target heart rate, but you can buy an inexpensive wrist monitor separately and use it when walking, jogging, or when you are one other equipment.To my mind, the way to make this machine better would be to add a magnetic (or even friction) resistance feature that could be adjusted during exercise.  It could be made even better by adding fitness programs that could adjust the resistance for you.6. Despite the title 'Fitness System' the Gazelle is NOT a complete workout.  This is aerobic exercise only and most professionals recommend some weight training to supplement aerobic exercise to maximize weight loss.  Tony Little implies on his infomercial that the Gazelle incorporates strength training as well as aerobic training.  Unless he is doing something different than is described in the manual, this is really only aerobic training.I don't think there is a better machine at this price.  The midrange ellipticals were very uncomfortable to ride and appear to have a lot of mechanical problems.  I would strongly recommend actually trying out the machines in a store before you buy on line.  The only way to know if a machine is comfortable is to actually try it.If you are a more advanced exerciser, you might want to opt to invest in the bigger/expensive machines of the type that are used in gyms or by physical therapists.  But if you are like me and want just a basic machine at a bargain price, this could be the one for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great little machine (no pun intended)", "unixReviewTime": 1146441600, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2006"}

I tried the gym and a personal trainer which was very effective, but too expensive for me to keep up when I retired. A friend had the Gazelle and she found it was the right kind of exercise for her. I tried her machine and liked it. I purchased the Gazelle from Amazon.The Gazelle came well packaged. The lubricated parts of the machine were well wrapped. My son-in-law put the Gazelle together for me. It is a little more complicated than I could handle. He used his own tools even though the set comes with everything you need. It took him about 30 mins to put this together. I watched the enclosed video, and I read the instructions.The Gazelle Edge info tells us this is the type of machine that provides a gliding motion that works the muscles of both the upper and lower body while burning calories and improving cardiovascular endurance. The machine is smooth and quiet - and stable. I found the machine provides a full-range of motion from a slow walk to a full run without sudden stops and without placing pressure on my joints. The low impact workout is ideal for me. I can choose to place  my hands in a low, medium, or high grip to alter difficulty with different results for the upper body.The Gazelle has an easy-to-use and battery-operated 5-function workout computer . The Gazelle makers even provided the 2 AAA batteries needed. The computer gives us the speed, distance, time, and approximate calories burned. The machine folds up quickly into a flat position for easy storage - just snap the foot platforms onto the swing arms before sliding the frames together. And, it's highly portable.  You can store it under a bed, or standing in a closet. I leave mine upright in a space I made in my bedroom.The Gazelle is an exercise machine for all, the fluid motion makes it easy to use. I looked at the reviews of all the ellipticals and other machines, and the Gazelle had the most favorable  reliability and satisfaction reviews. It is at a price that most everyone can afford.

I wanted the larger size, because I knew my girlfriend would inevitably want to join me, and I didn't trust a &#34;single&#34; hammock to support us both.To begin with, the hammock is very light and portable.  It comes with two very nice long ropes which are sturdy and rough enough to attach securely to just about anything, without being scratchy or stiff.  The stuff-sack/pocket is a nice feature, both for portability and practicality.  It accommodates a water bottle comfortably.As for the hammock itself, the material is soft and doesn't dig in or leave the awful lines that a netting type hammock does.  There is a little bit of flex to it, more so with 2 people in it, but that's not to say its stretchy or bouncy, just make sure that you mount it high enough to keep you butts off the ground.The benefit of the size, besides being able to accommodate 2 people in relative comfort is that it provides a wide variety of options for enjoying it.  I'm 6 feet tall, 180 pounds and I can lay comfortably lengthwise or width wise, or any sprawly variation thereof.  Additionally, if it's particularly windy or sunny, if you lay lengthwise, you can fold the outer portion of the hammock over on top of yourself, think of the pods that the blue people sleep in in the Avatar movie.  This will effectively stop wind, cut the sun and keep you dry in a light rain.  The best part was that using the hammock like this, I still had plenty of room to read without feeling claustrophobic.  The only caveat I would offer here is that this will get warm,  the hammock is quite good at trapping heat in this way, which may be a good or bad thing depending on the circumstances.  In any event, if you get too hot, just open it up for a second and let in some fresh air.  I will also say, that while the hammock is good at trapping heat in the airspace created, if you're laying directly on the fabric, any decent breeze will be felt taking that warmth away; something else to consider if you're planning to use this in cooler weather.  This could probably be solved by throwing a blanket or sleeping bag on first to provide some insulation.  This cocoon configuration also works with two people in the hammock if you want a little more privacy.  Just to be clear, this isn't bug proof, you'll still need a net if that's a concern.While I bought it primarily for it's portability, I believe that it's durable and comfortable enough for day to day use in the back yard or wherever you intend to set it up.  I don't think I would leave it out when I wasn't using it, but that's just taking good care of things.All in all, I'm very happy with this.  It's portable, comfortable, and while I haven't had it for long enough to truly put it through its paces and say definitively that it's durable, I don't expect to have any problems with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great all around hammock", "unixReviewTime": 1378944000, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2013"}

After some persistence, I figured out that this hammock NEEDS a structural ridgeline.  I found through trial and error that 95\" works best for me.  This allows me to comfortably lay on a diagonal.  And while not board flat, it is about as flat as your favorite comfy reclining easy chair, maybe even slightly flatter.  And the 95\" ridgeline eliminated the shoulder squeeze problem for me too.At first I thought this hammock was too big for me (I am 5'10\", 240 lbs), so I ordered a single size from Grand Trunk.  I still had a shoulder squeeze issue in that hammock, so I started looking into the problem more, and that is when I figured out the need for the ridgeline.  Now I think the extra size makes it more comfortable than the single, and I prefer it.I also use the structural ridgeline to hang my ENO bug net from, and to clip my light and ridgeline organizer too, so it ended up being a very practical and functional addition that improved my hammock experience in several ways, including reduced setup time (ridgeline stays attached to hammock, now I only have to hang for height of the hammock, the angle of the suspension is no longer a factor in the hang).I also had some problems early on with finding a good suspension system that would not stretch and leave me on the ground in the morning.  I finally settled on Kammok Python Straps and 2 climbing carabiners in the ends of the hammock.  I also wrote a review of the Python Straps and highly recommend them no matter what brand hammock you use.Hopefully some of these tips will help you enjoy your hammock a bit more.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some tips.", "unixReviewTime": 1338940800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2012"}

Well, not bent, but it has a noticeable curve beginning with the second eyelet of the top section.  I noticed this as soon as I first put the rod together and looked down the rod to align the eyes.  I own dozens of spinning and fly rods from Quantum to Okuma to Temple Fork to Orvis......all of which are straight as an arrow.  This rod's top section should never made it past QA.  Deep down inside I know it won't affect the terminal performance but on the surface it drives me nuts every time I hold it and see that right curve!

It simply won't.  That's not to say it is not flexible enough, it is, but it's not the same.

I bought my first spool of the Vanish line and witnessed my catch rates double, if not triple.  Snap-offs and knot failures became nearly non-existent, and the number of takes I received increased dramatically due to this line's underwater invisibility.  It is more durable and lasts longer than any mono I've previously used.  I've since taken to spooling all of my ice fishing rods with 4 lb. and 6 lb. Vanish.  Fish can drag this line all over the holes edges without damaging it.  Knot strength is ridiculous.  I haven't had any problems with excessive memory and coiling, possibly because I'm using the lighter test.  It costs more than average mono but the benefits are worth it, IMO.

Lots of folks use alternative knots: San Diego Jam, the Double Pitzen is popular with the pros, the Nanofil...  There's a lot of knots that claim to work with fluorocarbon line.I've tried them all both wetted and slightly moistened (recommeded) when cinching, and finally got tired of donating my hooks and lures to the river gods when the Vanish separated at the knot.  Just yesterday I watched a 1/4 ounce Panther Martin go flying off carrying a 10# Vanish leader when the Double Pitzen knot broke at the swivel.  It didn't come untied, it left a little bit of Vanish wrapped around the split ring.  It broke at the knot.When I realized all of my \"fluorocarbon\" knots were failing, no matter how many times I practiced them, despite pulling out a magnifying glass to see that they were tied properly, and despite the drop of super glue I tried using to secure the knot, I started researching these lines rather than buying the hype.  My bubble was burst!  Google is such a two-edged sword...There is no advantage that I can see to using fluorocarbon line other than that fluorocarbon line sinks.  Objective testing shows that it frays readily, although not as quickly underwater as a monofilament line; it stretches as much (typicaly more) than monofilament line; it is difficult (impossible, IMHO) to find a knot that will not fail early; it is not significanly smaller in diameter than high quality monofilament of the same weight rating; and Seaguar states on it's website that it's a myth that fluorocarbon line is less visible to fish (or to any other critter) underwater than any good grade monofilament...It tends to make very weak knots, it's stretchy, it frays easily, it's not skinnier, and it's not invisible.What's to like?  And at the price we're paying for it, I'm staying away.I will never again use, and would never recommend this or any other fluorocarbon fishing line.

It only protects the top part of your fingers, so unless you use the tips of your fingers to pull back the string, you're SOL.I was so disappointed in this glove, I just gave it to my little brother who is also getting into archery with me. Luckily the starter bow I bought isn't too rough on the fingers, but the 50# longbow I acquired roughs them up, so I'm back on the market for a good archer's glove.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I thought I'd enjoy it a lot more than I did.", "unixReviewTime": 1335916800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012"}

I added a 50' line on each end of the tool/saw. I found that lighter pressure makes an easy cut. If you pull with good force the teeth grab and hold firm. If you keep the lines a little slack with a  light touch it cuts very well considering what you are using. Heavy limbs come down without pinching the chain due to the mass. Smaller limbs twist and bind your chain. In this case I found that running a hand line up to the limb in addition to the saw helps. This way you can pull, or swing the branch to free up the chain. I did have one pinch, and while pulling on the rope the crimp failed. This shot the yellow line into my chest hard enough to leave a mark. I would tell anybody using this saw to remove the small metal clamp and splice the rope then finish the splice with tape. its stronger, and wont hurt you.

Living in Florida with a lot of hurricanes as well as almost daily afternoon thunderstorms means a constant onslaught of branches etc..of course, tree trimmers are not only expensive but it's a hassle to verify they are \"legit\" and have insurance in place to reduce the potential for a major lawsuit when they are working on the property. We needed several low hanging branches plus several not so low - and rather larger (8 inch diameter) - branches taken down for a quote of about $300. Purchased this and used for first time this morning. The branches are down and saved about 90 percent off the cost and hassle of hiring a tree trimmer...a bargain considering this is the first use. It's taken about 4 hours but the first hour was the worst because we got it kinked like others mentioned. Once you figure it out - this works like a charm. The ring broke - it's cheap and will need to be replaced - plus the ropes start getting to the hands after awhile - but all in all this was a superb deal. Also was able to take down several precarious branches that could not use a chainsaw with without severla man crew because of the branc going near vertical. Used this instead and was able to stand far out of the way while bringing down a sizeable branch.Money saving item - wish they put a bit more into the quality of the rope and accessories but is still a great buy!PS - Despite giving this a four star rating, I've actually purchased a second unit to use at a weekend cabin where we occassionally need to take care of a few odd limbs etc...just wish they would put a bit more quality into the product.

I had that problem and oiled it before trying the next limb and it worked much better. If you buy it treat it like a chain saw, keep the chain oiled and it will likely help avoid a lot of the binding issues, though not all.  The second aspect of this saw is to practice on low lying limbs which you can reach, before throwing it at the high ones.  This will allow you to get a feel for the saw and learn the tricks of laying out the line, throwing the bag, attaching the handles, and actually sawing a limb while being safe about it.  This sounds silly, but the chain tends to loop over itself and once it is swung over a limb it's too late to fix that and you have to start over. Or taking off the bag and watching the line fly into the air..and you have to start over. Or learning how to twist the line to position the saw.  Or learning the best angle to saw at.  This tool takes some practice and a bit of skill. Do a few smaller limbs, watch them crash down, and you immediately have a better understanding of how you can kill yourself if you are not careful!The saw seems to work best on smooth barked trees.  Rough bark tends to bind in the early stages and that maybe what a lot of people have a problem with. I found smaller limbs easier to handle.This is a sub-$40 tool.  You get what you pay for.  The ropes are plastic and will do the job, but they showed wear after a few cuts.  The chain is ok, but not as good a quality as a regular chain saw for a power model.  The clip that holds the bag on is second rate.  As another reviewer said, once you see the tool you find you could do the same thing for less money.  Well.... perhaps.I made a half dozen cuts and the tool saved me a few hundred bucks from the local Kine guys like \"cut da coconuts and climb the mango for trim.\"  Plus I didn't have to worry about some yoyo dropping a tree on my garage. (I could do that myself.) If it never cuts anything again it has paid for itself many times over.So if you care for the chain, go slow, practice on lower limbs, develop some skill and knowledge of how to safely use this tool, and then cut even a few high limbs you will have saved money if not time.  Don't expect wonders from a $40 investment.  But prudent use could easily save you 10 times your cost.

I managed to take down about eight limbs from 5 to 8 inches in diameter. If you have patience, a tall ladder, a long pole saw/trimmer, 50 feet of para cord and a helper you can get it done.It sounds ridiculous I know. If I need all of these extras to make the tool work whats the point? Well, without this little device, good luck trimming branches that are 20-30 feet off the ground without a boom truck.The saw gets caught up a fair bit which is why I needed the ladder and the pole saw/trimmer. I had to use them both to get the saw untangled at least once.When you do get the saw situated and you start cutting the saw blade will often get caught when the limb starts to sag. Out comes the pole saw/trimmer to aid in pulling on the sagging limb and snapping it free.Ultimately it was a pain in the tail to use but once you get the hang of it does get easier. The price for this device is steep in my opinion.If you are resilient, patient, have the equipment I suggested above and you are in good physical condition I would give it a whirl.

Many of the branches were a little too thick to be cut with the long pruning shears, or they were too high.  We especially wanted to remove a large limb hanging over our front porch since we live in hurricane country.The first time we used it, the link holding the sandbag to the rope broke, and I'm knocking off one star for that.  We fixed it with some heavy gauge wire, and continued with the job at hand.  You will need heavy leather gloves for the job - the rope will cut into your hands as you pull.With two of us working together (pulling alternately on the ends of the rope), we quickly cut all the unwanted branches off, and were very happy with the speed and sharpness of this tool - the chainsaw links cut through a 6\" branch in about 30 seconds.  The sandbag is perfect for tossing up over a branch, and the rope is long enough to get to branches 20+ feet in the air.  With a person standing on either *side* of the tree, safely out of range, there isn't much danger of the branch falling on them.  This tool can be used alone by one person, but it would be much harder to exert enough back and forth power that way.In case you end up with the blade side of the saw facing up (not down, on the limb), there's a handy key/metal piece on the end of the chain that will flip the chain over if you pull the key and chain all the way over the limb.  We needed this feature several times, and it worked every time.  It would be nice if the manufacturers made the chain with blades on both sides.  We'd pay extra to not have to fuss with getting the blades facing down!Compared to calling a tree trimming company and paying hundreds, this tool is a bargain!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Makes yard work a snap!", "unixReviewTime": 1338249600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2012"}

I need to tell you, though, that it is very small.This is only about five inches tall, including the horn.  The can itself is only three inches tall and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  The horn protrudes about 2 1/2 inches out.  It easily fits in my tackle box, and I am considering buying a couple more of these for safety.  I read recently that the one thing that scares a criminal away fastest is a loud horn.  If you found yourself in a home invasion situation, or walked in on a burglar, even if you had a silent alarm system, it is going to take the police several minutes to get to you, and a lot can happen in those minutes.  This is small enough to carry in a purse, or a pocket, or just to keep handy somewhere in your house.  I can guarantee you that this horn will turn heads a lot faster than a whistle!!  Whether you carry a weapon or not, you can use this to call attention to yourself and whomever is trying to commit a crime against you.  It will be a shock to an assailant's ears, and he might just decide you're not worth messing with!!  It's also small enough to carry when hiking or camping.  It is very light weight, and you could also use it as a backup horn for a larger boat that is already equipped with an electric horn.

The 303 isn't as slippery feeling as the Mequiar's, smells better and comes in several different sizes. The 32oz is a better buy then the 16oz, and the gallon is a really great buy. Just be sure to save your orginal spray bottle. I bought the 303 to use on my Soloflex Weight Straps as it is recommend by Soloflex, to stop the oxidation process. Mequiar's is recommend also. The weight straps are a dense rubber composite and the 303 is working great. There are no warnings on the 303 stating various items not to use it on, as are listed on the Mequiar's. So I have used it on the Soloflex bench and the Rockit bench and footrest, no issues. It may do a wonderful job on dashboards, but I haven't tried it.Soloflex only suggests using 303 Aerospace Protectant or Meguiar's M40 Vinyl and Rubber Cleaner/Conditioner as preventive maintenance. They however don't tell you how to do it. There isn't anything enclosed with my new replacement weight straps regarding maintenance or treatment of the rubber. Makes me wonder how they control aging of their stock.Since the straps are made of a dense-hard rubber compound, they aren't porous. To my way of thinking, just spraying the protectant on and wiping it off, doesn't give you the best bang for your buck. So I have been soaking them for several days in the protectant, in a Lock-n-Lock container. These containers are air tight, keeping the protectant from becoming thick and jelly like. I turn the straps once a day. This is another reason I like the 303 in the gallon size. If your straps are very old the protectant will turn black as the oxidation is washed off.  Then I wrap them individually in cloth and store them in another Lock-N-Lock container. Could also spray a light coat of protectant on each strap before wrapping. For very long term storage I'm thinking of vacuum sealing the straps in my Food Saver vacuum bags. No air, no oxidation. And since the pours would be forced open do to minus atmosphere, more protectant should be forced in.Since my Soloflex and Rockit are old and hadn't been used in years, and I wasn't aware the straps needed treatment, four of them broke first use after coming out storage. All (10, 5, 2.5#) broke in about the same place, a short distance from the plastic ring, going toward the center of the strap. There is a suspicious looking round spot in the center of each break, looks more like a molding imperfection then an aging issue.All of the new replacement straps look, feel and smell different then the broken straps and those that haven't broken, but are now treated. Soloflex told me the compound was the same, go figure. I'm treating all my straps, new and old. I want to pass the Soloflex equipment onto my grandkids, with usable straps.The reason I started using the Soloflex again, should of never stopped, my surgeon wanted me doing leg extensions to aid the rehabilitation process of my year old TKA. I had been using the Rockit without straps, but have since started adding straps. Has made a world of difference, especially with the breaking up of the scar tissue.

It went on like Armor All.  But, unlike Armor All, it is not a waterproof protectant.  In fact, before I wrote this review I went out to the garage and poured a little water on the rear fender and bumper.  The water clung to the surface.Now, I probably should have let it cure overnight, but I had this review to write.I wiped the water off and the 303 went with it.  What I mean is, the water was enough to remove the product.  I grabbed a paper towel, wiped it clean and reapplied the protectant again.  Like I say, maybe I should have let it cure.I'm not a big fan of Armor All, but it's all I've known for years.  It won't prevent sun fading, which is why I bought the 303, but it is water shedding.Bottom line, I bought the 303 protectant for the sun screen ability, so I guess I'm happy if it works.  Check out the 303 website for the instructions, which say to be very careful about getting it on other material surfaces.  My experience is that it is actually cleaner than Armor All when it over-sprays on the paint job.

Mother's works but one has to apply a lot of it to get where one wants to go: \"Back to Black.\"This stuff (303 Protectant) works a treat.  One sprays it onto a folded up washcloth and wipes 303 Protectant onto what ever it is the user wants to treat.  I treated the step-side rocker panel tread pads first cause due to the grooves, there's a lot of spray used and then used the mopped up excess to do door handles and mirrors.  If applying product in this fashion, there's little to no waste.Through experience, I found that Mother's, \"Back to Black\" bleeds onto the car's finish.  I just received this product and haven't washed the car to see if there's any bleeding problems.  If there is, the wife will immediately let me know as it's her car being detailed.  At first blush, this is an excellent product, provides immediate feedback (makes things look great) and at a delivered price I find competitive with local auto parts stores which sell Mother's, \"Back to Black.\"If over the next few car washes, anything is found that should be added to this review, I'll come back and amend the above review with additional user based information.Addendum: 27May13:We have washed the vehicle three times.I used this product on the back step panel of a 2000, Dodge, Durango.  All the rest of the black on the car came out great but two locations.  The piece of rubber at the top of the windshield, due to buffing compound impregnation and the back step panel, due to thirteen years of weathering.The solution to correcting the problem was to wipe the locations down with \"303 Aerospace Protectant\" which was sprayed onto a terry cloth sized wash cloth, soak and clean the offending molding.  After allowing time for drying and buffing with micro fiber cloth, liberally apply Mother's \"Back to Black\", massage into the finish, allow to dry, buff and then reapply \"303 Aerospace Protectant.\"That did the trick of maintaining the expected, when absorbed and dry, fresh, black look we strive for when using products of this kind.Eventually, I see our windshield and trim being replaced so as after thirteen years of use, will give this location on the vehicle a fresh start.(We're maintaining a thirteen year old vehicle and the alternative is to spend a boatload replacing the vehicle with used or new or, by comparison, spending a little to upgrade and maintain what we have.)Hope the above tip helps in your efforts to restore and maintain your car's appearance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow!

So I researched products and found this one.  I treated the vehicle when everything was brand new, as instructed. Over the years we got some grimy things on the car seats of that vehicle, and nothing ever penetrated into the fabric to the point where it wouldn't come out.  I have two dogs and sometimes they would drag in mud (and worse) onto the car seats.  Every bit of dirt that ever got on the seats and ceiling panel for that matter always came out.  I never got anything horrible on the seats (engine oil, ink, etc.) so I can't attest to how this produce would handle things like that.  I have since they used this product for shoes, indoor and outdoor seat cushions and lounge chair covers, etc.  Works well for a variety of applications.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product; have used it for several years with great success!", "unixReviewTime": 1384646400, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2013"}

Hanig", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have a Classics Accessories boat cover that I bought from Amazon back in 2010 that is still in excellent condition.  Unfortunately, its ability to repel water is no longer all it could be.  Doing a little research, I came upon this product courtesy of the Sumbrella folks and thought I'd give it a try.There are basically two steps and you need at least one day when it isn't going to rain to get the full benefit.  First, you clean your cover with 303 Products Fabric and Vinyl Cleaner.  I bought the 32 oz size and hardly used any of it.  A little goes a long way.  I just wet down the cover on the boat with water, sprayed some cleaner on it, then scrubbed it with a soft boat brush on a pole.  Hose it down well when you're done and walk away.  Come back tomorrow.  If it rains, no big deal. It's the application of the water repellent that requires 12 hours of sunshine; not the cleaner.The next day, I sprayed down the boat cover with the 303 Products High Tech Fabric Guard with Water Repellent.  I used one of those $15 pump up sprayers that you use to spray Round Up in your yard and it took the whole gallon to treat my boat cover (which is on a 17' power boat).  I walked away again.  12 hours later it was completely cured.This morning I stepped outside with a glass of water and threw it on the cover.  The water blew off the cover like a hurricane was chasing it.  Unbelievable!  Talk about hydrophobic!  I could not be more pleased.This isn't cheap but I can't see how anything else on the market could work better.  It is incredibly effective.  According to Sunbrella, I should be good for another three years, assuming the cover doesn't just wear out first.  It sits in the sun out in the driveway every day the boat isn't actually on the water.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This stuff is the bomb!", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}

Nothing soaked in at all - zero wet spots on the cloth top.  (Since the top is a light beige color any wet spots would show up slightly darker in color.)  Any water that didn't roll off the top was absorbed using The Absorber 51149 sponge-cloth available on Amazon or at WalMart.Process:1)  I gently cleaned my cloth convertible top using 303 Fabric Top Cleaner (303-30550).  To do this I first rinsed the top with fresh water, then sprayed the cleaner on & gently scrubbed using a very soft brush (I used Star Brite Soft Yellow Wash Brush 040013 available on Amazon).  A stiffer brush or too vigorous scrubbing could damage the fabric, scuffing the threads and creating a fuzzy look to the fabric.  I cleaned the top in slightly overlapping areas about 18&#8221; x 18&#8221;.2)  I rinsed the top and allowed it to dry thoroughly.3)  Using a 2&#34; paint brush and  small container of 303 High Tech Fabric Guard 30674, I applied the Fabric Guard brushing it on in a manner similar to painting.  By overlapping slightly I made certain I applied the product to every square inch of the top.4)  I allowed the top to dry several hours and applied a second coat of Fabric Guard.Notes:1)  When applying the clear Fabric Guard liquid with a 2&#34; paint brush it will start to have a slightly white/foamy appearance - this will go away completely and the product will dry clear.2)  After each application I noticed a VERY slight, very fine clear crystalline residue on my cloth top.  You had to look very closely to see it - it had just a little bit of sparkle to it in the sunlight.  This brushed off quickly and easily & probably would have blown off the  first time I drove the car.3)  Some reviewers seem to have issues relating to getting the product on the car itself saying it was hard to remove. I didn&#8217;t have this problem.  The few times that I over-brushed or got small drops Fabric Guard on the car itself I simply gently wiped it with a soft paper towel and it didn't damage anything or leave any residual coating.  It seemed to wipe off 100% with a soft paper towel.4)  READ THE LABEL !!!  The first paragraph covers some surfaces that you CANNOT use this product on without causing damage.  These include rubber, vinyl, clear vinyl, plastics, etc.  Since the product's Material Safety Data Sheet lists the contents as Petroleum Distillates, just a wild guess but prolonged contact with this product may have a  solvent effect on materials such as vinyl or plastic.5) I wouldn't purchase 303 Fabric Cleaner again &#8211; I think a bucket of hot water with a scant squirt of Dawn dish detergent would do just as good of a job.  Of course, you will need to completely rinse the top and allow it dry thoroughly before applying 303 Fabric Guard.6)  I have no idea how long my cloth top will remain water repellant after applying Fabric Guard.  I plan on doing this process every 6 to 8 months or sooner if I notice any water being absorbed by the cloth top.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Tech Fabric Guard 30674 Works Great on My Cloth Convertible Top !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}

That has to go the same for my trailer. Got a used trailer inside was like new and I think this trailer sat unused for a few years in the sun.Now I need to get the oxidation off this used trailer we just bought. I tried regular Mcquires for cars clearcoat cleaner compound on a 3000 rpm polishing wheel. Not good enough.I ordered through Amazon McGuires RV 3 step oxidation compound, polish and wax. Fiberglass is a tougher finish then clearcoat and this Oxidation compound is designed to cut through and really remove all the garbage and oxidation built on the finish. It restored my dull slightly off white finish back to bright white and very shiny. As well as me tired, But its well worth the effort.(UPDATE June 2013) I recently bought a used motorhome and went through the same process as I did with trailer in this original review from 2 years ago, JUST like the trailer it brought back the shine to new. I did discover that using the machine and just the McGuires fiberglass restorer compound. The wax in kit is great stuff but I find myself going back to a wax call Protect-all RV wax I used it for many years and following up with The Protect-all wax even brought and held the luster a long time plus the wax has UV inhibitors in it so it is a complete wax for any fiberglass or car finish. Tried McGuires Flagship wax too, makes it sparkle  but it goes on heavy and comes off harder leaves a film if you don't keep changing to new towels!!!!!!!!!!! Once you get your finish back the Protect-all is all you need to keep it that way forever as long as ya do it once or twice a year. Protect-all goes on easy comes off easy leaves high long lasting shineWARNING!........Their is nothing that will work without the right tools, time, strength and energy involved in taking on this big a surface on 29 ft RV with slide outs. You need a polishing wheel ( Not an orbital buffer they are not powerful at all. I tried the dual action kind they are easier to control but I like the speed of reg car polisher and prefer the 10 lb 7 inch 3000 rpm wheel using McGuires medium cut raspberry colored foam pad.This item: Meguiar's 7\" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Cutting Pad by Meguiar's $10.29 on Amazon......... Made just for taking oxidation and swirl morks safely out of the fiberglass and car finishes.I started on the full molded fiberglass cap front. IT had a dull SATIN LIKE white finish on it very minimal shine. After applying the compound with 3000 rpm wheel, polish then wax Its as shiny as a new trailer or a new bathroom tub at Lowes.LET ME TELL YOU THE SHINE JUST AFTER USING THE COMPOUND IS AMAZING! IT works as its advertised. Then you follow up with the polish on a rag and wipe it off right away. Polish takes off any film left by compound and adds oils back to finish. They have a pure wax but it has no UV blockers in it so I went back to what I used and loved for years on trailer---Protect all wax.Lack of UV blockers is what oxidizes the unit.Its a very hard job. I would say I would charge 500.00 plus to do someone else s but would never take on someone else s unit.Takes per side about 4 hrs but I have to stop because it will wear you out holding polisher tightly and letting wheel and compound do its job.Its a good workout. But the end results are well worth the time. My trailer had medium oxidation, but people who used it that claim they started with a chalky finish have had the same end results based on the reviews I read on Amazon.I AM sure with a BAD OXIDIZED chalky finish you will need to constantly clean the oxididation it removes off the pad.But years of not cleaning and waxing require the pain staking process that goes along with removing all the dead finish to get down to fresh.Please note.......... My trailer is 5 years old and though it was oxidized some but a dull shine was still apparent, I knew the gel-coat seemed still good. If your unit has been neglected for say 10 years or more it may be possible that the oxidation has gone beyond the Gel-coat finish which gives the fiberglass its shine. If so, Your really have nothing to shine back up. 3 part restorer will remove the oxidation  then the polish and wax will add oils back to finish but without the high gloss shine if the gel-coat is gone. Also the dullness may return as the oils dry out over the following weeks of months depending on fiberglass gel coat in bad condition. I would try a small section on an older unit and see if you get that desired shine before spending your efforts to restore the entire unit. If that is the case their are other polymer finishes that coat over the dead finish once you clear off dead oxidation and create a new shiny type coating that they claim will hold a nice shine back to old finish. I am sure you can see them on the net. People seem to like these products as well. I would only consider going that route if you indeed do not have a chance of restoring the gelcoat. At that point you have nothing to lose but you will have to reapply that polymer finish every year. But it seems easy as waxing the whole unit.  But at least you still have an option.Tip.... For cleaning deep dirt on caulking I care-full use lac-quire thinner on a small clean rag just folded to touch the caulking only. The thinner will melt the top layer of caulk every so slightly and remove the dirt instantly. Let it dry and then follow over the area with the wax, the wax will remove the film left behind and leave you trailer caulk look like new again.

The Motorhome fiberglass was a high shine gelcoat smooth finish which was dirty and oxidized as well, but you can still see shine beneath it......... but dull. The lower panels by storage area were factory painted with Auto paint a golden color but very dull. This entire coach I applied the same Mc Guires Fiberglass restorer to using Rasberry colored McGuires foam med cut pad. As I decribed before its work not an easy fix to remove years of neglect and you need a high speed wheel. Amazon has a few good buffing wheels for like 60.00 In fact I bought and used one and worked fine.Please practice holding and using one before you start ripping into your finish. It takes a little practice so take your time if you never used one. They are not hard to get the hang of once you spend a little time with it.Needless to say the 2004 coach looks like its new, the finish has a super high shine as it was manufactured to have.I like Protect all Rv wax with UV blockers in it on RV finishes. McGuires wax is fine to. I use this Ptotect-all wax once I complete finish back to new as my only wax and cleaner and you can use it on plastic, and rubber seals windows etc. Plus it holds up nice. Goes on easy comes off to a nice shine and has real wax as well in it. Love it. I never have to restore and finish again when I use this wax twice a year. Designed for RV units and is available all over.I also want to add the McGuires I had great success with as well is McGuires Ulitmate compound on cars as well as RVs using my high speed wheel or hand for hard to get spots.If you need to go over spot where you previously did with RV restorer try the McGuires ulimate compound as finish compound. It really removes dirt, swill marks of light oxidation and brings finish to an amazing glaze ready to be waxed. I usually follow up with it after using the Fiberglass restorer 1st round to lift out any light leftover oxidation 1st round left behind as well as bringing up super luster. Of cource this depends on how oxidized your finish was when you started process.If you are dealing with extream oxidation re-apply the restorer with wheel to take another layer of bad oxidaion off till finish looks shiny at all angles. Its just depends on the layers of oxidation, the compound just takes it off in layers Sometimes one angle verse another will show more then less to all cleared off finish. Always look at area your are working on at different angles to know your ready to move to another section. If I can post pictures of before and after I would.

These seem to have the perfect mix of stiffness and rubberyness to them to both deal massive blunt force damage to whatever it hits, but also prevent the arrow from detonating on impact.These are economical, and easy to use, and so far have made it even easier and fun to stump shoot as I know I will not break the arrow, and in many cases, it leaves a good clear mark where the impact took place, helping me further tune my instinctive shooting style.I have NO doubt that these will be absolutely LETHAL to any small game this hits, even in those not so vital hits that inevitably happen on small game when shooting instinctive, this will surely deliver enough impact to crush vitals and cause instant or near instant death from hydrostatic shock even in a less than perfect shot placement situation.Whats more, as it lacks any sharp points, I bet it will leave more meat and fur intact.However, seeing how it can penetrate solid wood at ten paces or less, I am a bit worried about this going through and through on some small animals, and as the head is bigger than a normal Judo... that could mean a LOT of meat ruined...Anyway, I would definitely recommend to a friend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "BAM!", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"}

I car camp extensively all over New York State and also fly to the National Parks and am able to take almost all of the gear that I use when car camping in NYS except for a porta-toilet.  I am a very active above knee amputee (with prosthesis) and probably do more than most people with 2 legs.  That being said, I don't sleep with my prosthesis on and if I need to use the facilities during the night it can be a pain to carry a flashlight while using crutches at 3 a.m.  I've always had to get the site right next to the facilities when I fly to my camping destination because of this.  These sites aren't always the best sites with regard to privacy and noise level due to the in and out traffic.  This eliminates (no pun intended) that problem.Since it's just the cover and is totally flat I can easily pack this (wrapped in a basic plastic shopping bag) into my 27\" pullman with my tent and other gear.  Or if I choose to send a box to the hotel I'm at for a night or two before heading to the campground I can ship it there easily along with other gear in a 14x14x14 box.  My favorite National Park to camp at is Rocky Mtn. NP in Colorado.  I can land in Denver, get my food supplies and swing by a Lowe's or Home Depot to spend a whopping $3 on a 5 gallon bucket.  Now I can get a more private site or one with a nicer view that's further away from the facilities since I can just keep it in my tent and take care of it first thing in the morning after I put on my prosthesis.I (gratefully) realize that my needs for this product are a bit unusual compared to others, but I think most can agree that no one really wants to trapse out of their tent at 3 a.m. to walk 10 sites down to use the facilities, esp. if kids are with you.  During the day it's no big deal to take that walk and a good leg stretcher, but at night stay snug in your tent and have this along.  Just be sure to empty it and clean it with camp soap first thing in the morning.

Many eggs, sausages, hashbrowns and pancakes have been cooked on mine over a two burner coleman liquid fuel stove and I've never had anything stick.  The only thing that could ever be improved with this basic design would be to add a grease sink on one side or a corner for bacon grease.  At times the bacon grease can get close to going overboard, so I have to periodically soak up some of the grease with paper towels while cooking bacon.  Cleanup is always easy and the aluminum griddle is easy to transport.  Just watch your heat and don't get carried away with over heating one side or the other or the aluminum may warp, but I have had no signs of warping with mine. Also be sure to use plastic spatulas to protect the non-stick coating.  The best part of the Cohlan griddle is that most of the ones I've seen say \"Made in the USA\" on them.  Coleman's version and some of the other off-brands are made in China, yet they are typically more money for the same basic design. I've seen these carried at my local Target and Fleet Farm.  For the price ($15 on Amazon) you can't go wrong with this Coghlan's.  I also have a Nordicware high-quality griddle... also non-stick, made in U.S.A. with a grease sink.  Not a bad griddle, but it cost more than twice the price.

You also assemble it by fastening 4 bolts that you can do up pretty tightly to give the thing a \"never going to come apart\" feel.The ONE thing I didn't like, is that the lid doesn't *latch* closed, it just lays closed. I think it's suppose to latch, but as you tighten said bolts during assembly, the metal flexes a bit and bows inward on the side just a hair, making the top stop snapping closed and only lay closed.I thought this would be a problem for me since I lay this thing down in the back of my car when I'm not using it, but because the top handles latch closed, they sort of keep the top flap from coming open, so I haven't really had any issues of the top popping open and balls emptying out into my trunk.The only modification I would have made to this hopper (and I've had a few hoppers) is to put a little metal knob on the top lid *just like* the metal one on the handles, so the top would snap closed... other than that I'm very happy with it, would definitely get it again as opposed to the Gamma one.One last note, the handles do come with rubber handle guards on them which is basically just some rubber hose (I noticed a lot of hoppers do this), I'd suggest taking this off... even though it makes the handles more comfortable to carry, when you flip the handles around and stand the hopper up on the handles, the little rubber guards can cause the legs to slowly spread out from under the hopper until it eventually falls over (sort of like someone on skates for the first time where their legs will slowly slide out from under them into the splits).If you never prop your hopper up like in the picture of this product, don't worry about it.

I've used these tennis balls many a time and they are indeed \"extra duty\".  They are durable, easy to see, and overall good quality.When I was a kid we used to play baseball in the backyard.  When we first started, we used a hardball.  However, there were too many close calls where somebody would hit a home run into the neighbor's backyard across the street and the ball would bounce and hit their sliding glass door.  So, we quit using hardballs and began using tennis balls.  So, baseball became tennisball.  We used to also stand in the middle of the street and toss the tennis ball up in the air and hit it with a tennis racket as far as we could.  The ball would often sail through the neighbor's trees, knocking off a lot of leaves, much to the dismay of the neighbors.  So, these Penn tennis balls can serve multiple purposes should you so desire.I've been watching the U.S. Open and what I absolutely HATE is on-net advertising.  There's a Mercedes-Benz logo on the far end of each side of the net.  I thought it was bad enough when the NHL began to allow on-ice advertising.  Now tennis has been allowing on-net advertising for some time now.  I swear, everything is a commercial nowadays.  I can't even watch a short video on YouTube without an advertisement popping up immediately.  I can't even watch a video on Comcast Internet without hearing, \"The following is brought to you with limited commercial interruption by (fill in the blank).\"  Then I have to wait for anywhere from 15-40 seconds before the commercial ends and I get to see the video.Anyway, I recommend these Penn Extra Duty tennis balls.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tennisball, anyone?", "unixReviewTime": 1347062400, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2012"}

They seat all the way in & does its job well.  Great for nightstand...In the 5-shot version, I read that Ruger LCR with Hogue tamer grips don't work well.  I have a Ruger LCR with the Boot grip.  There are no issues with the loader getting hung-up on the grip (like the Tamers).  The problem is that the 5-shot spacing is not identical to the Ruger.  Thus, the further the speedloader is seated, the results are your casings getting wedged in the cylinder.  For best results, seat the ammo about 1/3 of the way down -- anything further & you can really get wedged in.  To simulate a stress situation, I pushed the loader in deeper... the results were that when I twisted the release knob, the rounds did not drop in the cylinder... & I had to finesse the loader off the wedged rounds.  If you force the loader free, a couple rounds could easily come back out & drop (leaving you with a randomly filled cylinder).While these work well enough for range time, beware of its limitations for CC use or other stressful fire situations.  On the plus side, I've become much faster & comfortable with my Bianchi Speedstrips ;)P.S.

Mostly fits though.So, I have come back to update my review.  If you own the Ruger LCR 357 do not buy this item!  Buy the J2 speedloader from Five Star Firearms (or anywhere else you can find it).  I still give this one 4 stars because it works (kind of) but the J2 is made for the LCR and works perfectly, and is made of high grade aluminum.  It is more substantial, it fits the LCR with the hogue grip or the crimson trace grip and it is 10X faster.  The cost is 19.95 each, so it is more, but well worth it if you want a product that works absolutely perfectly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works okay", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

Speed loaders require a little bit of practice to get exactly right, but once you've put in a bit of range time with them, you'll be reloading faster than you could ever do manually.  At the range, using these I can reload faster than my semi-auto shooting friend.These speed loaders are themselves easy to load.  Just twist the knob to the open position, drop six rounds in, and twist it back closed.  The springs hold the rounds securely until you're ready to drop them into the cylinder.  To load the gun, just open the cylinder, hold the cylinder securely with your left hand, use your right hand to drop the speed loader into place, give a quick twist to release the rounds, drop the speed loader, close the cylinder, and you're back in action.This particular speed loader is for .38 special, and .357 magnum, and while designated for the Colt detective special, I've found does just fine for reloading most any 6 shot revolver in the same caliber.  I don't carry the Detective Special anymore, but I still use this speed loader for the gun that replaced it.Be it on the range, in self defense, or on the job for those of us in the security industry, if you prefer the simple reliability of revolvers, you need speed loaders.

If you haven't used a speed loader before, this unit will drop the shells about 1/3 of the way into the cylinder, where you will twist to release them and then using gravity, allow the rounds to drop the remaining distance into the cylinder.Overall:HKS makes great products at an affordable price.

Ross \"Bacchuskitty\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I got several of these speedloaders for my Ruger GP100 and I can say this:  They make for a WAY better shooting experience than hand loading one cartridge at a time.  I've put them to the test in many environments, from relaxed to stressed, and with many brands of ammunition and they've yet to break, fail, or degrade.  Here are highlights of my experience with these excellent speedloaders:*  Quality - Every HKS speedloader I've ever had has worked the first time, every time, in every condition.  Simple in design, the speedloader has few moving parts so there is little to break or go wrong.  They are made of high quality materials that have stood up to many uses over time.*  Durable - I've never had one of these break or fail on me, despite frequent use and dropping plenty of them on the concrete, dirt, and sand.  They are rugged and have stood up to use and abuse and continue to work perfectly.*  Reliable - This is critical for those who really need to reload as if there life (or stopwatch) depended on it, and these units have never failed or stuck.*  Simple to Use - Easy to load, these speedloaders make redoading a snap.  Release the spent casings, insert speedloader, and with a twist you are good to go.*  Fast - These are much faster than reloading by hand, but it also takes practice and technique.  Under stress, I'm not sure these would be a benefit to someone who really needed to reload very quickly unless they were well-practiced - see comments below.Cons:*  Fiddly - In theory, these pop in six (in my model) rounds relatively quickly, but here's the thing:  Releasing the cartridges takes a twist of the knob.  That same twist of the knob will also want to rotate the cylinder of your handgun, so you've got to keep the cylinder from spinning with a finger from your other hand.  No big deal, you say?  No, it's not when you are sitting on your couch watching your favorite spaghetti western.  But what about in competition?  What about when you are being timed?  What about in the dark?  Under stress?  My point is this:  While it's not a complicated or lengthy process, using a speedloader quickly and effectively is still a process, one over and above the act of popping open your cylinder and shoving rounds in by hand.  It takes some practice to do it quickly, without binding the cylinder, or accidentally twisting the knob too early and spilling all your cartridges at your feet.  For those of you who started out with a semiautomatic handgun where you just slap a magazine in, you may be surprised at how fiddly these are in comparison.Other Thoughts:Here's where I give the product four stars rather than five.  Up until fairly recently, these speedloaders were the best.  A new design is out there now where the cartridges are released with a press of the knob rather than a twist - I do believe that to be a better design if time proves the design to be equally reliable.  Pushing the knob precludes the cylinder from turning, removing a step from the process (holding the cylinder), making it - theoretically - simpler, easier, faster, and safer.  I've yet to use that other design, so I'll withhold judgement for now and stick with what I know works every time, time after time:  HKSOne would do well to try both designs to see which one works best for them, but in the meantime I can easily recommend these reliable, tough units that take the chore out of reloading wheelguns.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Speedy, Effective, Tough", "unixReviewTime": 1352073600, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2012"}

I tried the second speedloader to see if perhaps I had just received a lemon, and sure enough, the other loader was no better.

As most folks would understand and be able to visualize the length of 410 shot gun shells approximately 2-1/2\" long, and consequently no one has made a speed  loader to acomodate these shells used in my Taurus Judge 45LC/410.As my son suggested the simple but well thought out solution, we'll give him the credit. I was going to punch a hole in the center of the velcro flap above the center allowing the speed loader handle to pop through.As I stated above my son asked me the obvious question; \"why not add a strip of velcro to the speed loader strap?\"  Indeed, I said...  I have strips of velcro that are 1\", 2\", and 3\", wide in various lengths.  So a pair of scissors 2 pieces of velcro and my 410 shotgun shells have a comfortable home.In addition, the speed loader case is extremely flexible that gave me concern. To resolve this issue I took a Bayer Aspirin Bottle and cut it off to the heights of the 410 gauge speed loader and the second bottle to the height of the 45 caliber speed loader to make them more rigid. This resolved the lack of rigidness and unsightly (rumpled) appearance.What is interesting about these types of pouches or cases is the fact that they can be altered for a specific use. I know I would have butchered up a leather speed loader case, so all went well.Great product, great price, all in all a great buy...Douglas Page Chapman Sr.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Altering the Cordura Speedloader case", "unixReviewTime": 1342310400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "A1U4JWHUO6QDVP", "asin": "B0000C1CMF", "reviewerName": "Marcus", "helpful": [27, 28], "reviewText": "This HKS cordura nylon speedloader case is decent quality for a light-duty case, but if you are looking for a case to put on a duty belt or on a stiff gun belt for home defense, it is not the best choice. It has no internal stiffeners to keep the case open for inserting the loaders, and the Velcro closures are not as secure as a snap closure. However, it may be a good option for concealed carry because, unlike the rigid duty belt cases, it doesn't stick out much from the belt.This case holds two speedloaders.  It is 3-1/2\" wide and it has one full-length belt loop that will slide on belts up to 2-1/4\" wide.  For use on a narrower belt, it is possible to sew a line of stitching through the belt loop (on the top side), so the belt loop will not be as loose.The main advantage this nylon case has over a rigid speedloader case is that it can be flattened or folded over with a rubber band for storage to take up very little space - and not look like an ammo case.  With the speedloaders inserted, it also sticks out a  less from your belt than a rigid case, if that is a concealed carry concern.The only other advantage might be an application where you would want to wear the case unloaded, rolled over inside a casual belt so it just looks like a small flat belt case.  Then it can be quickly rotated to accept the speedloaders.The semi-rigid HKS Hytrel plastic cases or leather cases from other manufacturers are much better if you are going to keep the case permanently on a duty belt or a gun belt.  The snap closure on the rigid case is more secure than the Velcro on the nylon case.  For self-defense, inserting & removing the loaders is also easier with the rigid case.The nylon case only comes in one size to fit all size HKS speedloaders, so it is loose when holding the medium HKS speedloaders, such as those for 5-shot 38 Special or .357 Mag.  However, this can be fixed by sewing a line of stitching on either side of the fuzzy Velcro to take them in about 1/8\" on both sides of the Velcro.One other tip to improve these soft nylon speedloader cases: You can buy one of those plastic containers that hold little tubs of  friut drink mixes; then cut out about a 1-1/2\" strip from the top of the container, and roll it up inside the case to make a rigid tube around the speedloader.  This keeps the case open for inserting the speedloaders.In contrast, the HKS rigid Hytrel cases come in two sizes, medium and large, and the medium is supposed to fit the five-shot loaders and other even smaller loaders for 22LR. The Hytrel case costs about $5 more than this nylon case, and is available in smooth finish or basket-weave.Galco and some other holster companies make nice small single leather speedloader cases that wrap around a regular pants belt and snap closed (brown and black color).  They are very nice leather, but expensive.By the way, an alternative case option for the medium size speedloaders from HKS is to use one of the  leather cell phone cases (for the older \"candy bar\" size cell phones). Many of these  have a spring steel belt clip, elastic on the sides, and a full velcro cover flap. You can stack two medium loaded speedloaders in these, and they are discreet for concealed carry defense.On some of these cell phone cases, the elastic doesn't go all the way to the to the bottom, so the bullets in the ends of the bottom cartridges are just a bit noticeable on the sides.  However, this can be fixed by fashioning a small piece of bent black plastic (or even cardboard blackened with a marker) to hide them.  It would be shaped like a tall \"U\" in the  bottom of the case.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fair speedloader case, but big for the HKS medium loaders", "unixReviewTime": 1300060800, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2011"}

The threads are clean and crisp. They screw into standard cleaning rods very smoothly. Yes I tried them on a 3 piece aluminum rod and a one piece tipton rod.

But its not ideal...I ordered this to reload Bersa Thunder 380 magazines. The construction of the loader is about what you'd expect for 12 bucks ! Cheesy! Its made from cheap injection molded plastic parts. Its held together by a thin metal clip/ring which is held on by tiny serrations.The \"instructions\" , printed on the back of the wrapper, are literally  incomprehensible. Parts and places are referred to but there is no diagram identifying them, just a teeny illustration about 1/2 inch square.HKS dont bother to print separate instructions to match the model you purchased. So until you notice that , you are trying to decode and follow the wrong set of incomprehensible instructions.You eventually will divine what you are supposed to do, and  loader does work. The  function of the loader is to allow you to hold the magazine and exert downward pressure on the cartridges already in the magazine with one hand while you use your other hand to slip another cartridge into the loading ramp. When you get the hang of it, you can slip new cartridges in effortlessly and without any resistance from the spring in the magazine.*********************************************************************************Hints:Its best to insert the first cartridge by hand before you put the magazine in the loader.Adjust the front retaining bar and the lower retaining bar on the loader to hold the magazine snugly.Grasp the loader and magazine like a gun.Press the lever on the loader with your thumb to push the arm of the loader down on the top cartridge. You dont push down on the \"follower\" itself.The technique is to use the leverage of the loader to push down the top cartridge just enough to slide in the next cartridge without pressure from below.Use your free hand to slide the new cartridge in about half way along the length of the cartridge below. Do NOT leave enough space for the new cartridges to drop down into the magazine.When the skirt of the new cartridge reaches the lips of the magazine,you release the arm on the loader.THIS makes room for the cartridge to be seated all the way to the rear of the magazine... using your thumb.Then you lower the loader arm back onto the new top cartridge.Shampoo . Rinse . Repeat.Sounds really complicated but its pretty simple after you see how it works.********************************************************************************Some of my factory Bersa Thunder 380 mags are the single stack 9 round version, with an extended \"toe\". They dont fit in the loader because the toe sticks out too far. That is a disappointment, since I only really wanted \"help\" loading the higher capacity magazines which have proportionally more resistance than the smaller magazines.Five stars for function, price and to get you to read the hints!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Learn from my mistakes..read these hints!", "unixReviewTime": 1299715200, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2011"}

The product comes with a spray tube so that you can spray it very precisely, without making a mess.Guns require frequent cleaning and lubrication.  This product does the job, lubricates the moving parts, and really acts as a cleaner as well--apply and wipe off and the dirt and carbon is gone.  I will apply with a rag, or spray into difficult to reach areas such as slide rails, and then wipe with a Q-Tip to ensure that everything is clean.

Inspect the blade for rust; there is none.2 wipe off old oil.3. Apply new Rem Oil.Sword oil will never be applied to my Katana replica again.I am not saying not to get a sword maintenance kit. You will need it for the brass hammer, replacement bamboo pins, and the powdered ball to ultimately clean and polish the blade. I am only saying that you will not need to use the powdered ball anywhere as often.ORIGINAL REVIEWI used Rem Oil on my Colt .380 semi-automatic, and my Remington model 700 .243 caliber high powered rifle ages ago, and was always satisfied with it's performance.Then last month I was given a 1060 high carbon replica Katana as a combined birthday / Christmas present.At first I bought a sword maintenance/cleaning kit.The instructions said to clean and oil the blade monthly. I used the powder to clean and polish the blade, then the sword oil to oil the blade.Earlier in the season there was a problem with the A/C and I started checking the katana weekly instead of monthly, and after 1 week I was noticing tiny rust spots on the blade.Last week I had a squeaky hinge, and wanted to get some oil to lubricate it. I checked my katana and three tiny rust spots about 1/2 of a millimeter across.I got the idea to use Rem oil on the blade instead of the sword oil, and all I can say is WOW!!!The rust spots were gone in a few seconds, and the beauty of the folded steel came to life as never before!I have treated my katana only once with rem oil. But so far I am very pleased with the performance.I do notice one odd thing about Rem oil of today vs 30 years ago. 30 years ago rem oil looked like oil (the color of honey) today Rem oil is clear.

The first advantage of the Bore Snake is that it is a little more flexible with regards to use (OK for calibers from .270 to .284).Using the Bore Snake couldn't be simpler:  you drop the end with the weight through the barrel (breech to muzzle, same direction as the bullet would travel), and pull it through.  There is a brass brush embedded in the fabric to loosen any fouling or corrosion, and the fabric behind the brush cleans it out.  For good measure, I put some Hoppe's #9 cleaner in the fabric before the brush to assist with loosening any fouling, and some Rem-Oil in the fabric behind the brush, so I was able to clean and lubricate in a single pull.For a &#34;white glove&#34; cleaning, I could still see use for rods, patches, and soaking, but the Bore Snake is great for regular cleanings, and would be particularly great for quick cleaning immediately after a shooting/hunting session.

I still use patches, bore cleaner, gun oil etc periodically as additional cleaning, but for small calibers (like my .17 HMR), the nylon tips are vary fragile, and break easily if the patch is not cut small enough.  Regardless, after a good bore cleaning, remember to clean the chamber.Many have reported that their bore snake cannot go down their barrel.  I had that problem with my .22 Long Rifle.  I could not draw the snake through the bore.  But after a few months I tried it again, it was snug, but nicely snug as opposed to too tight.  The problem seems to be that when these are packaged they are flattened and tightly bundled.  This seems to make the snake rather wide and flat and unable to properly compress as it is drawn through the rifle.  If you don't want to leave it out until it returns to round, you can work up and down the snake, squeezing the edges towards each other and forcing the snake back into a round shape.  Make sure you force the inner cords of the snake into round as you do this.  I did this for the snake I got with my new .17 HMR rifle.  Prior to squeezing, I could not pull it through and was afraid of tearing the snake or the lead cord.  After working over the snake, making it round, the snake was a little snug, but it went through.  Further passes went easier and now the snake is nicely snug.Extending this discovery  to storage, the last thing I want to do is wind it tightly and flatten it again.  I put it loosely in a small plastic watertight box that fits in a pocket of my range bag.  I hope this information  helps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bore Snake great (after making it round)", "unixReviewTime": 1372982400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2013"}

The snakes for handguns and non AR platforms work well and with little issue. The caveat is the AR platforms, if your running a match grade barrel in 223 id recommend that you not use this BS. The lack of tactile feedback could leave your rifling damaged or a BS stuck in your barrel. Not to say the BS would cause the damage directly but more likely a large piece of particulate etc.. getting stuck in the snake and being raked down the barrel. For your average sportsman or tacticool user a BoreSnake is not a bad investment. They are really good at cleaning out the gunk left in your barrel when shooting steal case ammo like Wolf or Tula.My biggest complaint is the breaking of the pull cord. I am a moderate shooter, approximately 300 rds a month on my  5.56's and 200-300 rds on my 308 so I might use a snake  2-3 times a month. They average about 7-8 cleanings before the cord breaks.I have read a lot of reviews where users swear by these, I would as well for a quick clean however over time they just don't last making the bang for your buck rather underwhelming.  I do want to point out that I have used snake's on my 45's and 9mm well over 100 times, I have never had to replace either and I believe I have at least 100 more cleanings before I would even consider the need to replace.

Number one fault, the cheap nylon cord breaks. I have had it break on three others, but have not ried this out yet. With the others, I complained to Hoppe's and they sent me new ones. Keep complaining about this problem, maybe they will fix it (but probably not). Also, they do wear out. A brush on the end of a cleaning rod can be replaced for a couple of bucks, these, not so much. These are good for a quick run through cleaning out in the field, but should not be substituted for a proper cleaning.I hadn't bought any gun cleaning equipment in a number of years and when I started to get the stuff from Hoppe's, it all says made in China.

I didn't want to put the cleaning rod with a bore brush into the end of the barrel because I don't want to take a chance of bending it or the rod and maybe screwing up the rifling.I read the instructions that came with it and they were pretty basic so I called up Hoppe's and asked if there was any more to it than what it said on the package.  I was told to put a \"few drops of [what else] Hoppe's bore cleaner just below where the pull cord is attached to the wider portion, a \"few drops\" of oil at the end and run it through a couple times.  He also mentioned I could wash it in the washing machine if I put it in a mesh bag so the bristles wouldn't tear up the other clothes.  I don't generally put oily things from gun cleaning into the washing machine so I suppose I'll wash it by hand.I didn't have an eye dropper so I'm sure I put more than a few drops of bore cleaner and oil on it, but it wasn't soaked or dripping wet.  I ran it through the barrel two times.  My eyes aren't as good as they used to be so looking in the bore using a bore light wouldn't have done me much good to see if it was still dirty or not. To check to see how well it worked, I ran a clean dry patch into the end of the barrel through to the breech a couple of times. The only thing on the patch was a little bit of oil.Since I had the thing out I decided to use it to clean my new Ruger Mark III 22/45 that I had shot up a mixed bunch of brass plated and lead rounds, about 400 in all.  I used the Boresnake exactly as I used it with the 10/22 but it took four passes with it to get it clean, probably because of the lead bullets.  I put a dry, clean patch on a cleaning rod (from the barrel's breech) and got the same result, a clean patch with a little oil on it.As of now, I'm very pleased with the Boresnake and would recommend it.

Now for the problem... This is for cleaning .22 caliber rifles.  I bought it for cleaning my AR's specifically.  The brass &#34;weight&#34; that they put on the end of the pull string was too big to slide through the barrel!  Thus, the product was useless in the condition it was delivered.  My first boresnake had a much smaller weight that easily slid down the barrel allowing me to quickly pull the snake through cleaning my barrel in seconds.  I figured out the problem (other than the obvious fact that the weight was too big)... The weight Hoppes is using has the caliber number stamped on it to identify which snake to use.  Great idea if you have multiple snakes, but the weight size needed to fit the stamp was too big to fit a .22 cal.  After squeezing the weight with pliers, I reshaped it enough to barely thread it down the barrel, which took longer than using a a rod and patch set.  In the end, I had to dremel the weight to make it useable.  Very frustrating.  I don't foresee this being a problem with calibers bigger than .22 though, because they probably use the same size weights on the other snakes.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Disappointed in comparison to original boresnake.", "unixReviewTime": 1361145600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2013"}

Since I do not have access to a lathe I took an electric drill and 1500 grit sandpaper and reduced the diameter of the Pro-Shot brass jag I had until Butch's patches would fit, it took about 45 minutes of sanding and checking.

{"reviewerID": "A1U4JWHUO6QDVP", "asin": "B0000C50SR", "reviewerName": "Marcus", "helpful": [49, 49], "reviewText": "This HKS plastic double speedloader case with snap closures is rigid and secure. The speedloaders insert and pull out easily. It is designed to work on police duty belts as well as smaller width belts.  Since it is rigid and sticks out about 2\" from your belt it isn't great for concealed carry unless you can cover them with a loose garment. Of course by law you probably don't have to cover them like your firearm.It has a rigid belt loop molded on to the back (without a snap), which will fit belts up to about 2-1/8\" inches.  A 2-1/4\" duty belt will also fit, but if the belt is over 3/16\" thick it will be very tight pulling through the belt loop. Thinner belts will obviously work, but the case won't be held as securely. On a thin belt, it will obviously be able to slide back and forth.For street use, a stiff, thick 1-1/2\" leather belt is a good compromise with this case. To use it with a 1-1/2 belt: Cut out a strip of 1/4\" thick, 1/2\" tall cardboard and insert into the bottom of the slot.  (Or glue two thinner pieces of cardboard together with Elmer's white glue.) This will keep the case from tilting as you draw out the speedloader. If you want a more permanent solution, wrap a couple of turns of 1/2\" wide flat black nylon strap (or leather strip) though the bottom of the slot and sew the ends together with needle and thread.The case is actually made out of Dupont Hytrel, which is a quality textured polymer material that looks a lot like leather. This case is smooth black, although HKS also makes it in a molded basket-weave pattern.  According to the back of the HKS package, they also make this same Hytrel case in tan or brown color (though I have never seen those sold anywhere).I prefer this rigid case over the other one-size HKS speedloader case made out of flexible Cordura nylon, which just has Velcro cover flaps.  The HKS Cordura nylon case doesn't hold its shape well like this case for insertion of the speedloaders, and it doesn't hold them as securely.  However, the advantage of the Cordura nylon case is that it is more compact and sticks out from your belt less than this rigid case (especially if you sew it a little tighter around the speedloader), and it can be squashed flat with the speedloaders removed.  So the cordura nylon case is probably preferable to wear under a coat, vest, or loose shirt for concealed carry.I believe HKS used to make a similar leather case, but I haven't seen those at any stores lately.  There are similar leather cases available from other police duty belt makers, but they are about double the price.  Some of the other makers also have Cordura nylon covered duty belt speedloader cases with a rigid plastic frame.  They cost just a little more than this Hytrel case.  However, I think most of these other makers just make one size for six-shot revolvers.  The HKS comes in two sizes, with one for the smaller speedloaders (which they call medium).Galco and some other holster companies make nice small single leather speedloader cases for concealed carry that wrap around a regular pants belt and snap closed (brown and black color). They are very nice leather cases and much better for concealed carry than this HKS duty belt case, but they are expensive.The two sizes in this HKS case are designated large and medium.  The back of the package says large fits HKS speedloaders 27, 29, 25M, 25, 5, 57M,  and the medium fits speedloaders 10, 586, DS, M3, PY, CA44, 36, 22. (See hksspeedloaders dot com for a chart.)  There are actually smaller size HKS 22LR six-shot speedloaders, but I don't know if they make a small size case for these also.If you are using the medium case to hold the 36-A 5-round HKS speedloader for the Ruger SP101 and other small 5-shot revolvers, the speedloader is a little loose in this medium case and will rattle slightly if you walk briskly.  However, you can cut out a curved piece of plastic from a powdered drink mix container, which will curve around the speedloader in the case and hold it tighter and prevent it from rattling.By the way, an alternative case option for the medium size speedloaders from HKS is to use one of the leather cell phone cases (for the older \"candy bar\" size cell phones). Many of these have a spring steel belt clip, elastic on the sides, and a full velcro cover flap. You can stack two medium loaded speedloaders in these, and they are discreet for concealed carry defense.On some of these cell phone cases, the elastic doesn't go all the way to the to the bottom, so the bullets in the ends of the bottom cartridges are just a bit noticeable on the sides. However, this can be fixed by fashioning a piece of bent black plastic to hide them -  like from a plastic pocket folder (or even cardboard blackened with a marker). It would be shaped like a tall \"U\" in the bottom of the case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Secure speedloader case, but synthetic material, not leather.", "unixReviewTime": 1313193600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2011"}

It is made of DuPont Hytrel, a strong, durable synthetic material that looks like leather, but is a lot less expensive than leather.  It is also much more rigid than the double Cordura fabric speedloader cases, which makes the HKS Speedloader Double  Case easier to use.  Plus, when the HKS Speedloader Case Hytrel tabs are unsnapped, they spring open and stay open, out of the way, which certainly can't be said of the Cordura material cases.

But if you're using a Ruger Security Six .357 Magnum Revolver for CC, I'm guessing you probably aren't that concerned about the slightly bulky profile your empty HKS Double Speedloader Case has, since it works so very well with the HKS MK3-A Speedloaders, which work so extraordinarily well with your Ruger Security Six .357 Magnum, when compared to any of those smushed down empty Cordura fabric cases.

Broke it down to it's base components, finished stripping the stock and re-did the stock with the stock oil.  In my opinion the stock looks far better now than it did the dark  brown it use to be.Took awhile to figure out the bluing process the instructions are all there, guess I'm just a bit slow.  Tried re-bluing just the portions that needed it but soon found it was easier to strip the entire barrel and receiver and redo all of it.  Still haven't gotten the hang of it down quite right.

Degreaser was ok...I used brake cleaner and then wiped it all down with the degreaser, so I only used just a little bit.  The tru oil was good too.  I didn&#699;t use the stain at all, but I will on my next project gun. And I didn&#699;t use the wood conditioner either.  Instead I sanded the old finish off my gun, then used about 6 coats of the tru oil, and finished that off with about 6-8 coats of wood wax.  That worked out well.It was actually easier than I expected. Just take your time, and be ready for the smell!  Make sure you do this in a well ventilated area.

I did use 2 cans of brake cleaner to clean the rifle and then followed instructions using denatured alcohol. Be sure to clean very well, and how well you prep the gun will determine your finish. Also be sure and use latex or rubber gloves. Remove all old blueing and rust then polish metal to shine using 400 or 600 grit sandpaper. You must get the final coating of oil on very quickly after blueing as the metal will rust almost immediately. Have your oil ready and soak it down, then let it cure for a day. I do not think this will hold up as well as factory or hot blueing, but is something you can do yourself fairly cheaply and if you take care to keep well oiled should last for years.

These are very handy for sighting in a rifle (as long as the rilfe has been bore sighted first).  The target is layed out with a 1\" grid.  Many scope adjustment knobs are in 1 MOA clicks, which give you approximately 1/4\" of movement at 100 yards at maximimum (or otherwise indicated) magnification.  By observing your point of impact (relative to your point of aim) and subdividing each grid into 1/4 intervals, you can figure out how many clicks left/right and up/down you need to zero your scope.  If you are shooting at less than 100 yards, you will need to do some relatively easy math.  For example, a 1 MOA click at 50 yards would give you 1/8\" of movement on target.I would suggest shooting a 3 to 5 shot group initially to verify point of impact. Then I would make the necessary adjustments, followed by another 3 to 5 shot group, followed by fine tuning.  Keep in mind that different types of ammunition (and different bullet weights) will have different ballistic behavior.  So, zero your scope in with the type of ammo you plan to use for your hunt, or that you use most often at the range.  Try some other types of ammo after you have your scope zeroed to observe how the point of impact changes.  Record your findings on a note pad, and you can make scope adjustments in the field to bring your scope to zero if you need or want to change out ammunition.One nice thing about this target is the 5 bulls eyes to shoot at.  After I've shot these out, I pick out the 4 points formed by the \"T\" intersection of the 4 sets of bulls eyes (top 2 plus middle, left 2 plus middle, etc.).  Then I will start shooting at the points of each diamond.  You can get a lot of mileage out of one target.I purchase these targets at a local sport goods store.

With that said it's got all you need. Recommend. However If I would do it all over,  I would go ala carte, meaning buy stuff separate. Since I bought the kit, I bought a can of Birchwood Gun Scrub (aerosol in can with straw), Mil-Comm Synthetic Lube grease to supplement my kit.The kit comes with (at least mine did) a small bottle of CLP gun cleaner, lubricant preservative in one small squeeze bottle. I tend to not lean towards one-in-all cleaner lubricant, but it's good stuff I am sure, 4.5 stars on amazon. I used it, seems to clean and lube just fine. Keep in mind most of ALL gun cleaning stuff like Hoppe's No. 9 and lubricants are petroleum distillate products of some kind. I tend to like one product to just clean and another separate product to just lube... seems the combo deals have to compromise somewhat? Maybe not. My preference really.With that said, the Kleenbore comes in a nice box, which is a good thing. It has a standard handle/rod tool, standard bristle BORE brush (brass) and cotton cleaning patches,  to shove through your barrel to apply cleaning solvent, clean and dry barrel bore.  Plus it has a two ended nylon brush, one small and one large. A tooth brush would work, but this is trick nylon brush.Most of cleaning is just wiping it down. DO NOT SLATHER your firearm with solvent. Second DO NOT OVER LUBE...Third people spend way too much time and money on cleaning their gun. If I had it to do over I'd buy a bore tool (the rod) and brush seperate, without solvent/lube or cleaning patches. I would buy everything else separate, a bag of cleaning patches, dedicated cleaner (like Hoppe's #9 or other like Birchwood) and dedicated lube (too many to mention but Mil-Comm synthetic or Hoppe's Precision Lube).

The tools are all secured in by rubber molding, which is great because I think the rubber grips better than plastic or foam, and the rubber won't break if stepped on by accident.As far as cleaning goes, it's good for the basics, but if you're looking for an all encompassing kit, I'd get the mega one Otis offers for $100, because you'll be needing to buy little different components to get into the nitty gritty of cleaning your rifle, like additional picks and receiver brushes.

This system allows for assembled cleaning of anything from my .223 RRA to my 12 gauge A400.

They do not get it as clean but it is easier and quicker.The place this really stands out in my opinion is on a disassembled clean.  This system got my barrel looking amazing!  I found that pulling the system through was much much easier than pushing a rod through.  The several attachments for cotton pads makes sure they get a full 360 in the barrel, and anyone who says different needs to read the instructions again (or watch the videos on here).  I would highly recommend this, and will not be switching back anytime soon.Pros:-Can field clean, although not as easily as a bore snake-Easier to get brushes and pads through the bore then a rod system-Cleans just as well if not better than any of my older rod systems-Comes in a great easy packaging with good labels and instructionsCons:-Does not have any picks or brushes besides the bore brushes-The pads are expensive, although they do work very easily and wellOverall I would buy this again in a heartbeat, I am very pleased with it.5 Stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much better than a rod based system", "unixReviewTime": 1335484800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2012"}

Crespo", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "I bought this kit right after getting my Savage 64FXP, only to find that I couldn't completely use it due to the included .22 brush not fitting inside the rifle, it was just too long. Looking around Amazon I took a chance and purchased the Otis #21 brush (also for .22 caliber, just shorter) and it fit just fine. I may or may not be sure on this one either but the instructions say to use an adapter (the obstruction removal) along with the T-Handle to put out the cable, this adapter seems to be missing for the .22 cable or is not offered at all, I have 2 obstruction removals in the kit but neither will fit with the smaller cable for the .22, one is larger/thicker than the other but otherwise they are the same, even the threads that you would use to screw into the cable you would use it on.I also have a Savage Axis in 30-06 that I tried the kit on and while it was a better experience it did cause a scare. The sample patches worked just fine with the 30-06 but when it came time to use the included brush (specifically for 30-06), it got stuck! I pulled and pulled using the adapter and T-Handle on the larger cable with the brush not budging, so then I tried to push it back the other way but the cable wasn't stiff enough. Thankfully you're able to unscrew the cable by twisting it counterclockwise but that just left the brush stuck in the barrel.Thankfully I took a rod from my old kit (Wasn't I glad I didn't throw it away after &#34;upgrading&#34;) slowly slid it in and gave it a few whacks hoping I wouldn't damage the crown, the reason why I got the Otis kit in the first place. This got the brush out but it amazes me that for a company that touts ease of their brush use by clearly indicating what brush is for what caliber they sure don't do a great at it.I then tried their 27 brush thinking perhaps they stamped both brushes wrong (I know that was a long shot, but still) and of course it would just slide around in there since it was so much skinnier. Begrudgingly I thought I'd give the 30 brush another shot and while I was still met with a bit of resistance after a few more tugs the brush finally started moving along until it came out the other end.Beside these small complaints though the kit serves it's purpose and is light, small and best of all portable, I'd definitely recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great kit", "unixReviewTime": 1361491200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2013"}

Nye", "helpful": [58, 84], "reviewText": "I purchased the Otis Tactical cleaning kit (not from Amazon -- got a better deal elsewhere at the time) to care for two 12 gauge shotguns, a pair of .22 cal target pistols, several .38 cal and .357 magnum revolvers, and several 9mm and .45 cal pistols.  From its advertising it seemed like the perfect \"one size fits all\" cleaning kit.  But it does not live up to the hype.This kit does come with some basic tools to clean all common types of guns, including the needed slotted tips and bore brushes.  But it does not have the (optional) picks and brushes needed to do a thorough cleaning.  That will cost you another $15 or so.  Only a small number of patches come with the kit, so you should plan on buying more right away.  Interesting, no one who sells these cleaning kits locally in my area also sells the Otis patches.  So I had to purchase those online (which I did buy from Amazon).  The patches cost about 10 times the amount you would spend for common square patches.  Even though Otis claims you can get 6 uses out of each patch I found you will drag dirty patches through your barrel if you try to get that many uses.  At best you may get 2 or 3 uses from each Otis patch if you really want your gun to be clean.  In all I spent about twice a much for this cleaning kit as I did for a similar comprehensive rod-based cleaning kit.So how well does this kit clean your guns?  The patches will clean your bore about as well as any other slotted patch system.  But I find I can get the bore much cleaner using a jag and rod.  The fact that you can pull the patch breech to muzzle is handy, though, for revolvers.  But if you clean your gun the way Otis illustrates in their instructional videos it will not get very clean.  If you dissassemble your gun you will find the breech end of the bore is not very clean, and the slide is filthy.  You will need to scrub all of these areas with a brush (which the kit does not include but sells separately) and wipe it down with patches (don't use your expensive Otis patches for this unless you want to spend a fortune on patches).In the end, the Otis cleaning kits (they make several but work fundamentally the same way) are useful if you want to take a compact cleaning kit with you to the range or hunting where taking a cleaning rod would be a hassle.  If you want to do just a quick clean of your bore without disassembling your gun it will work fine.  It is handy to clean the bore of a revolver from breech to muzzle.  If you think a Bore Snake cleans your gun sufficiently then you will probably be happy with the Otis system.  But don't expect this kit to clean your gun as well as you can clean it with full disassembly and use of a simple rod and jag with much cheaper patches, a toothbrush, and some solvent (I usually use Hoppes and BreakFree).  I have spent many thousands of dollars on nice guns.  I don't mind spending money on a good gun cleaning system to protect that investment.  But you will spend a fortune on the Otis cleaning system and, in the end, your guns will not be all that clean.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "disappointing cleaning kit", "unixReviewTime": 1286668800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2010"}

This trigger guard area is actually the main retention device, other than just friction fitting -- so it's pretty important to get the trigger guard area properly fitted I would think.

The gun physically fits into the holster dimension-wise, but the trigger guard does NOT properly \"snap\" into place, it just kinda spreads the plastic apart, which is not good and does not provide more than just friction fitting.I liked the idea of the holster for an inexpensive way to carry around a 9ve on the farm, but I never got a chance to test the product out because it didn't even fit the gun, mainly due to the trigger guard area.

I've seen them in their packaging at some firearm stores and they did look kind of cheap, but I have been seeking a holster for my H&K; USP 45 Compact for a while now to use as a home carry holster.The CONS:First I would like to start with the description.This is an area Amazon and their vendors need to fix. They need better descriptions and a way to contact the vendor for questions.  If you look at the photo you see a paddle behind the holster but the main title says belt. I was under the impression you get both just like Blackhawk holsters.  Well this one just come with a permanent fixed belt attachment. Ok, you know what they say about what happens when you ASSUME.Second issue I have which can also fall under the first issue I have is that this holster will NOT fit the H&K; USP 45 COMPACT if you have a rail adapter on it. (I have a GG&G; Slimline Rail adapter).  I was unable to find a review saying it would not fit and it says nothing about it in the description.Third issue: After removing my rail adapter, this holster doesn't really fit this firearm well, you can see that it is very tight and the seem of the holster is just about splitting. Definitely will put wear on the finish of my firearm if used often.Fourth issue the mold has bumps and scratches all over it like it has been used.The PROS:Low cost for someone who wants a belt attached holster.If you own a threaded barrel, this will fit.That's my gripe.Overview:I will be keeping this holster because when i received it I didn't bother to look and see the packaging was zip-locked and I ripped it open so this item will not be resellable as &#34;NEW&#34;.I did try some of the other firearms I own and my Sig Sauer Mosquito slides in this well however the sight clips the bottom of the holster when drawing the firearm.There is a seperate paddle adapter you can purchase for this holster right here on Amazon for just under $10.00, but if you do the math, you are better off buying a BlackHawk serpa holster as they are definitely better quality as I own a bunch with carbon fiber detailing for my other firearms and they come with both attachments (Paddle and Belt) and cost is about the same if you buy the paddle adapter.  Unfortunately I did not have enough patience to wait for one for my USP.  I believe they just recently made one for it, not sure if the rail adapter will fit either.As information for some people reading this that is about to recommend a custom Kydex holster.
